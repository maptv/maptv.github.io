Greetings! <img src="asset/wave.gif" width="25px"/>

Welcome to my personal website, which I created using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org) publishing system.

You are currently on the [Home](){.bi .bi-house-door} page of my site.
You can use the [Sidebar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidebar_(computing)#:~:text=a%20graphical%20control%20element%20that%20displays%20various%20forms%20of%20information%20to%20the%20right%20or%20left%20side){.bi .bi-layout-text-sidebar-reverse} on the left to go to the [About](about){.bi .bi-info-circle}, [Listing](list){.bi .bi-grid-3x3-gap}, and [Curriculum Vitae (CV)](cv){.bi .bi-file-earmark-person} pages of my site or my profile pages on [GitHub](https://github.com/maptv){.bi .bi-github} and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maptv){.bi .bi-linkedin}.
The remaining items in the sidebar are sections that cover topics like [art](art){.bi .bi-brush}, [history](art){.bi .bi-hourglass-split}, and [science](art){.bi .bi-stars}.
In addition to the sidebar, you can also use the [arrows[]{.bi .bi-arrow-right-short}]{.bi .bi-arrow-left-short} at the bottom to move between specific pages on my site.

Have fun looking around!
