Greetings! <img src="asset/wave.gif" width="25px"/>

Welcome to my personal website, which I created using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org) publishing system.

You are currently on the [[]{.bi .bi-house-door}&thinsp;Home]() page of my site.
You can use the [[]{.bi .bi-layout-text-sidebar-reverse}&thinsp;Sidebar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidebar_(computing)#:~:text=a%20graphical%20control%20element%20that%20displays%20various%20forms%20of%20information%20to%20the%20right%20or%20left%20side) on the left to go to the [[]{.bi .bi-info-circle}&thinsp;About](about), [[]{.bi .bi-grid-3x3-gap}&thinsp;Article List](list), and [[]{.bi .bi-file-earmark-person}&thinsp;Curriculum Vitae (CV)](cv) pages of my site or my profile pages on [[]{.bi .bi-github} GitHub](https://github.com/maptv) and [[]{.bi .bi-linkedin}&thinsp;LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maptv). The remaining items in the sidebar are sections that contain articles on many different topics. In addition to the sidebar, you can also use the [arrows[]{.bi .bi-arrow-right-short}]{.bi .bi-arrow-left-short} at the bottom to move between articles in a given section or on to the next section.

If you are not sure where to begin, I recommend starting with my articles on [[]{.bi .bi-arrow-repeat}&thinsp;Dec](dec), a measurement system that I created, and then continuing on my [[]{.bi .bi-markdown}&thinsp;Quarto](quarto) section to learn about how I customized my website to show Dec dates in every article and the navigation bar.

Each article contains at least one navigation chart ([navchart]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="navigation chart"}). As with [breadcrumb navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_navigation#:~:text=allows%20users%20to%20keep%20track%20and%20maintain%20awareness%20of%20their%20locations%20within%20programs%2C%20documents%2C%20or%20websites), you can click on any node in the [navchart]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="navigation chart"} below to go to the article that it represents.

Please feel free to take a look around!
