Yesterday, [2024+184]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="2024-09-01"}, marked 85 years since the start of [World War 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#:~:text=a%20global%20conflict%20between%20two%20coalitions%3A%20the%20Allies%20and%20the%20Axis%20powers) on [1939+184]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="1939-09-01"} with the German invasion of Poland. The war officially ended 6 years and 1 day later on [1945+185]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="1945-09-02"} when Japan surrendered. The German surrender on [1945+068]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="1945-05-08"} is commemorated with [Victory in Europe Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day#:~:text=day%20celebrating%20the%20formal%20acceptance%20by%20the%20Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II%20of%20Germany%27s%20unconditional%20surrender%20of%20its%20armed%20forces%20on%20Tuesday%2C%208%20May%201945), typically on [Day 68]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="May 8"} in [the West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world#:~:text=nations%20and%20states%20in%20the%20regions%20of%20Western%20Europe%2C%5Ba%5D%20Northern%20America%2C%20and%20Australasia). In contrast, many countries in Russia's [sphere of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence#:~:text=a%20spatial%20region%20or%20concept%20division%20over%20which%20a%20state%20or%20organization%20has%20a%20level%20of%20cultural%2C%20economic%2C%20military%2C%20or%20political%20exclusivity) commemorate [Victory Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day#List_of_associated_holidays) on [Day 69]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="May 9"}. The chosen commemoration date can therefore be viewed as having [political significance](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1406122/baltic-ambassadors-snub-moscow-victory-day-event). On [Day 69]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="May 9"}, the European Union celebrates the anniversary of the [1950 Schuman Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuman_Declaration#:~:text=a%20proposal%20to%20place%20French%20and%20West%20German%20production%20of%20coal%20and%20steel%20under%20a%20single%20authority) with a holiday called [Europe Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_Day#:~:text=a%20day%20celebrating%20%22peace%20and%20unity%20in%20Europe%22). The Schuman Declaration aimed at normalizing relations and promoting political integration in Europe. Today, many countries that were opponents in World War 2 are now close allies, notably Germany, France, and Poland and the US and Japan.
