[Day 184]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="September 1"} in the [Gregorian Decalendar](/dec/date) is the first day of [Season 2]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Fall in the Northern Hemisphere and Spring in the Southern Hemisphere"} by [meteorological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season#Meteorological:~:text=reckoned%20by%20temperature%2C%20with%20summer%20being%20the%20hottest%20quarter%20of%20the%20year%20and%20winter%20the%20coldest%20quarter%20of%20the%20year) reckoning and also the anniversary of the start of the [World War 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#:~:text=a%20global%20conflict%20between%20two%20coalitions%3A%20the%20Allies%20and%20the%20Axis%20powers). On [1939+184]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="1939-09-01"}, World War 2 started with the German invasion of Poland. On [1939+200]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="1939-09-17"}, sixteen days after the start of the war, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the East. Germany and the Soviet Union split Poland according to the [Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact#Secret_protocol:~:text=a%20non%2Daggression%20pact%20between%20Nazi%20Germany%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Union) signed on [1939+175]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="1939-08-23"}. The map below shows the German and Soviet invasions of Poland on Days [184]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="September 1"} and [200]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="September 17"}, respectively, of Year 1939, as well as other military movements over the course of the subsequent 1.83 years before Germany ended the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on [1941+113]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="1941-06-22"} with its invasion of the Soviet Union as part of [Operation Barbarossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa#:~:text=the%20invasion%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20by%20Nazi%20Germany%20and%20many%20of%20its%20Axis%20allies).

On the map, exact dates on the map are in the `year+day` format and approximate dates are decimal years. For more information on these date formats, take a look at [date page](/dec/date) in the [Measurement section](/dec) of my site. Briefly, the `day` in `year+day` counts the days since [Day 0]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="March 1"} and can be divided by the number of days in the year to obtain the [fractional part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_part#:~:text=the%20excess%20beyond%20that%20number%27s%20integer%20part) of the decimal year. In the legend, there is a date range in the `start:stop` format, which is inspired by the [slice syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_slicing#1991:_Python) in the [Python programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29#:~:text=a%20high%2Dlevel%2C%20general%2Dpurpose%20programming%20language).

World War 2 officially ended on [1945+185]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="1945-09-02"}, 6 years and 1 day after it began, when Japan surrendered. The German surrender on [1945+068]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="1945-05-08"} is commemorated with [Victory in Europe Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day#:~:text=day%20celebrating%20the%20formal%20acceptance%20by%20the%20Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II%20of%20Germany%27s%20unconditional%20surrender%20of%20its%20armed%20forces%20on%20Tuesday%2C%208%20May%201945), typically on [Day 68]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="May 8"} in [the West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world#:~:text=nations%20and%20states%20in%20the%20regions%20of%20Western%20Europe%2C%5Ba%5D%20Northern%20America%2C%20and%20Australasia). In contrast, many countries in Russia's [sphere of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence#:~:text=a%20spatial%20region%20or%20concept%20division%20over%20which%20a%20state%20or%20organization%20has%20a%20level%20of%20cultural%2C%20economic%2C%20military%2C%20or%20political%20exclusivity) commemorate [Victory Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day#List_of_associated_holidays) on [Day 69]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="May 9"}. The chosen commemoration date can therefore be viewed as having [political significance](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1406122/baltic-ambassadors-snub-moscow-victory-day-event). On [Day 69]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="May 9"}, the European Union celebrates the anniversary of the [1950 Schuman Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuman_Declaration#:~:text=a%20proposal%20to%20place%20French%20and%20West%20German%20production%20of%20coal%20and%20steel%20under%20a%20single%20authority) with a holiday called [Europe Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe_Day#:~:text=a%20day%20celebrating%20%22peace%20and%20unity%20in%20Europe%22). The Schuman Declaration aimed at normalizing relations and promoting political integration in Europe. Today, many countries that were opponents in World War 2 are now close allies, notably Germany, France, and Poland and the US and Japan.
