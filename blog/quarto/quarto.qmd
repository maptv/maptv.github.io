I strongly believe that everyone, regardless of their background and current technical skill level, can learn and benefit from Quarto. [Getting start with Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) is easy thanks to its [excellent documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) and vibrant community of enthusiastic users and developers.

Rather than repeat the basic information already available elsewhere, I will share some advanced techniques along with the fundamental knowledge needed to understand how they work. The topics I cover are very technical, but my goal is to make the content on my blog as accessible as possible.

The first topic I will delve into is creating and publishing a website with Quarto. To get started, follow the Quarto documentation on [creating a blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html). As soon as you create the starter template, you can set it up to be publicly available using one of the many available publishing services.

# Publishing a Quarto site

To demonstrate some of the many free website hosting options, I published my personal website to four different hosts: [Quarto Pub](https://maptv.quarto.pub), [Netlify](https://maptv.netlify.app), [GitHub Pages](https://maptv.github.io), and [GitLab Pages](https://maptv.gitlab.io). Of these four options, only GitLab Pages is not supported by the [`quarto` `publish`](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-publishing.html#publish-command) command and only Quarto Pub is not compatible with the [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#:~:text=Git%20(/%C9%A1%C9%AAt/)%5B8%5D%20is%20a%20distributed%20version%20control%20system%5B9%5D%20that%20tracks%20changes%20in%20any%20set%20of%20computer%20files%2C%20usually%20used%20for%20coordinating%20work%20among%20programmers%20who%20are%20collaboratively%20developing%20source%20code%20during%20software%20development.) version control workflow shown in @fig-git.

```

If you do not plan to use Git, I recommend deploying your site to [Quarto Pubs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html) with the `quarto` `publish` command. On the other hand, if you are going to use Git to version control the source files of your site, you have no need for the `quarto` `publish`.

Netlify git workflow setup: Site configuration > Build & deploy > Link repository > Deploy with GitHub|GitLab
GitLab Pages git workflow setup:
  - add `.gitlab-ci.yml` to root of your git repo and push
  - uncheck **Use unique domain** under `Deploy > Pages` in the GitLab sidebar to have a shorter [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#:~:text=A%20Uniform%20Resource%20Locator%20(URL)%2C%20colloquially%20known%20as%20an%20address%20on%20the%20Web).

control system, you may prefer to host your site on [Quarto Pubs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html) or [Netlify](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html). On the other hand, if you are are already using `git` and hosting your site on GitHub or GitLab Pages, you have no need for the `quarto` `publish`.

[Quarto publishing documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) 

In my experience, the `quarto` `publish` works Publishing to [GitHub Pages](https://maptv.github.io) with `quarto` `publish` requires setting up your site to be built from a `gh-pages` branch instead of `main`, which for me was a dealbreaker.



 If you want to host your site on [Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), the Quarto [publishing documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/#getting-started) is all you need.
::: {.callout-warning}
The rest of this section focuses on GitLab Pages. Quarto does not officially supported by GitLab Pages, so if you are just starting out, you should choose one of the other options and skip down to @sec-nav.
:::

The Quarto documentation does not discuss [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/), but you can follow the [GitHub Pages instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) and then add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, like the one below, to the [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#:~:text=Git%20(/%C9%A1%C9%AAt/)%5B8%5D%20is%20a%20distributed%20version%20control%20system%5B9%5D%20that%20tracks%20changes%20in%20any%20set%20of%20computer%20files%2C%20usually%20used%20for%20coordinating%20work%20among%20programmers%20who%20are%20collaboratively%20developing%20source%20code%20during%20software%20development.) [repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)#:~:text=In%20version%20control%20systems%2C%20a%20repository%20is%20a%20data%20structure%20that%20stores%20metadata%20for%20a%20set%20of%20files%20or%20directory%20structure.) (repo) containing your Quarto-rendered site. After pushing to a GitLab remote repo,

```{.yaml include="../../.gitlab-ci.yml"}
```

If your site is published on [Quarto Pub](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html#publish-command), [Netlify](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html#publish-command), or [GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command), you can use the [`quarto` `publish`](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-publishing.html#publish-command) command to update it. The `quarto` `publish` command does not work for GitLab Pages, but GitHub and GitLab Pages-hosted sites can be updated using the standard Git workflow shown in @fig-git.



To make it easier to maintain my site on both GitHub and GitLab Pages, I set up my local repo cloned to have two `origin` remote URLs using the code in @exm-remote. Now, whenever I run [`git` `push`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) in my local repo, Git pushes my updates to both GitHub and GitLab.

::: {#exm-remote}
```{.sh}
git remote add lab git@gitlab.com:maptv/maptv.gitlab.io
git remote add hub git@github.com:maptv/maptv.github.io
git remote set-url --add origin $(git remote get-url lab)
```
:::

To make the `git` workflow displayed in @fig-git easier, I use the [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell#:~:text=A%20Unix%20shell%20is%20a%20command%2Dline%20interpreter%20or%20shell%20that%20provides%20a%20command%20line%20user%20interface%20for%20Unix%2Dlike%20operating%20systems.) [alias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_(command)#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20alias%20is%20a%20command%20in%20various%20command%2Dline%20interpreters%20(shells)%2C%20which%20enables%20a%20replacement%20of%20a%20word%20by%20another%20string.) shown in @exm-aacmp to combine the `git` [`add`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add), [`commit`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit), and `push` commands into one step. This alias allows me to provide a [commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(version_control)#:~:text=In%20version%20control%20systems%2C%20a%20commit%20is%20an%20operation%20which%20sends%20the%20latest%20changes%20of%20the%20source%20code%20to%20the%20repository%2C%20making%20these%20changes%20part%20of%20the%20head%20revision%20of%20the%20repository.) message that describes each update directly on the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#:~:text=A%20command%2Dline%20interface%20(CLI)%20is%20a%20means%20of%20interacting%20with%20a%20computer%20program%20by%20inputting%20lines%20of%20text%20called%20command%2Dlines.), e.g. `aacmp rewrite first blog post`.

::: {.callout-warning}
Un-escaped special characters in the commit message following the `aacmp` alias will be interpreted as shell command operators! If you don't know what this means, I advise against trying to use this alias!

For more information on the git, the tool used by 93% of software developers worldwide, according to [survey results](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/01/09/beyond-git-the-other-version-control-systems-developers-use/#:~:text=Our%20developer%20survey%20found%2093%25%20of%20developers%20use%20Git.) published by [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tour) on `2022+314`[^2], take a look at the ["GitHub for supporting, reusing, contributing, and failing safely"](https://openscapes.org/blog/2022-05-27-github-illustrated-series/) post by [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com) and [Julie Lowndes](https://jules32.github.io) on the [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org/) [blog](https://openscapes.org/blog). If you are just getting started with Git, I suggest using a standalone Git [graphical user interface (GUI)](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or the Git interface that comes with a code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/vscode.html) or [RStudio](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html).

# Customizing site navigation {#sec-nav}

Once your site is [built](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#quick-start) and [published](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#publishing), you can make it easier to navigate with a customized navigation bar (navbar) and sidebar, as described in the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html). Check out the `_quarto.yml` files for [my site](https://github.com/maptv/maptv.github.io/blob/main/_quarto.yml) and the Quarto [documentation site](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/blob/main/_quarto.yml) to see how the navigation components are set up.

In my navbar, I added a toggle buttons for [reader mode](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html#reader-mode) and [dark mode](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#dark-mode). The other icons on right side of the navbar are spelled out in the sidebar.

My navbar also provides the current date and time in `Dec` ordinal (`deco`) format, which counts the [years since 1 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#:~:text=year%200000%20being%20equal%20to%201%20BC) and the days since March 1. `Dec` is a calendar and time system that I created and use throughout my blog.

To add a custom [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp#:~:text=A%20timestamp%20is%20a%20sequence%20of%20characters%20or%20encoded%20information%20identifying%20when%20a%20certain%20event%20occurred%2C%20usually%20giving%20date%20and%20time%20of%20day%2C%20sometimes%20accurate%20to%20a%20small%20fraction%20of%20a%20second.) to the navbar, I put a `<script>` [element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#:~:text=An%20HTML%20element%20is%20a%20type%20of%20HTML%20(HyperText%20Markup%20Language)%20document%20component) that runs `time.js` in an [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=The%20HyperText%20Markup%20Language%20or%20HTML%20is%20the%20standard%20markup%20language%20for%20documents%20designed%20to%20be%20displayed%20in%20a%20web%20browser.)

Importantly, JavaScript can override the default styling provided by Quarto by modifying `style` attributes, which have the highest [specificity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#Specificity:~:text=Specificity%20refers%20to%20the%20relative%20weights%20of%20various%20rules.) in [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#:~:text=Cascading%20Style%20Sheets%20(CSS)%20is%20a%20style%20sheet%20language%20used%20for%20describing%20the%20presentation%20of%20a%20document%20written%20in%20a%20markup%20language%20such%20as%20HTML). If I cannot get a [CSS rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#:~:text=Each%20rule%20or%20rule%2Dset%20consists%20of%20one%20or%20more%20selectors%2C%20and%20a%20declaration%20block.) to work in the [`styles.css`](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/content.html#defining-styles) in the root of my site repo, my last resort is to replace the CSS [selector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#Selector) with JavaScript code that obtains the target element and applies the CSS rule [declarations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#Declaration) as a `style` attribute.

JavaScript, Python, and Lua are programming languages that have all have interesting name origins. JavaScript is named after the Java‚òïprogramming language, Pythonüêçis named after the [Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python#:~:text=Monty%20Python%20(also%20collectively%20known%20as%20the%20Pythons)%5B2%5D%5B3%5D%20were%20a%20British%20comedy%20troupe%20formed%20in%201969) comedy troupe, and Lua is the Portugueseüáµüáπword for moonüåï.

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a program that converts documents into practically any format. The pan in Pandoc comes from the Ancient Greek word for [*all*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pan-#:~:text=pan%2D-,all,-Usage%20notes%5B). Pandoc strives to convert *all* document formats, just like [Pangea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea#:~:text=Pangaea%20or%20Pangea%20(/p%C3%A6n%CB%88d%CA%92i%CB%90.%C9%99/)%5B1%5D%20was%20a%20supercontinent%20that%20existed%20during%20the%20late%20Paleozoic%20and%20early%20Mesozoic%20eras.) contained *all* the land and a [panacea](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/panacea#English:~:text=A%20solution%20to%20all%20problems.) solves *all* problems.

Quarto uses Pandoc to convert markdown files into target format(s) like `html` or `pdf`. If the source files contain executable code, Quarto executes the code via one of two computational engines: [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/#:~:text=Free%20software%2C%20open%20standards%2C%20and%20web%20services%20for%20interactive%20computing%20across%20all%20programming%20languages) or [Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/#:~:text=the%20knitr%20package%20was%20designed%20to%20be%20a%20transparent%20engine%20for%20dynamic%20report%20generation%20with%20R). @fig-render shows the Quarto workflow.

Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel's Quarto tip series includes a similar [Quarto workflow mermaid diagram](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/posts/21-diagrams/#fig-mermaid) and her ["Hello, Quarto!"](https://mine.quarto.pub/hello-quarto) rstudio::conf(2022) keynote with [Julia Stewart Lowndes](https://jules32.github.io) contains truly beautiful Quarto workflow images by [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com): [1](https://mine.quarto.pub/hello-quarto/#/publishing-system-2), [2](https://mine.quarto.pub/hello-quarto/#/quarto-flattens-the-learning-curve), [3](https://mine.quarto.pub/hello-quarto/#/quarto-can-grow-with-learners-in-a-profound-way), and [4](https://mine.quarto.pub/hello-quarto/#/quarto-cli-orchestrates-each-step-of-rendering).

Quarto controls Pandoc, Jupyter, and Knitr in two ways: 1) with arguments passed to the [Quarto CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#:~:text=A%20command%2Dline%20interface%20(CLI)%20is%20a%20means%20of%20interacting%20with%20a%20computer%20program%20by%20inputting%20lines%20of%20text%20called%20command%2Dlines.) commands and 2) with [YAML](https://yaml.org/) key-value pairs in `.qmd`, `.ipynb`, or `.yml` files.

Normally, [formatting dates in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/dates#using-a-date-format) is as easy as setting the `date-format` YAML property. In my case it was more difficult, because I wanted dates based on `Dec`, a calendar and time system I created, instead of the ubiquitous [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#:~:text=The%20Gregorian%20calendar%20is%20the%20calendar%20used%20in%20most%20parts%20of%20the%20world.).

As shown in @exm-date, I set `date-format` to `x` in `_metadata.yml`, which converts the date of each blog post to millisecond [UNIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time#:~:text=Unix%20time%5Ba%5D%20is%20a%20date%20and%20time%20representation%20widely%20used%20in%20computing.). I wanted to calculate the `Dec` calendar (`Decalendar`) dates from UNIX time, so that I could work with a single number and not have to deal with Gregorian calendar date formats or time zones.

The `Decalendar` dates in my blog are called `Decalendar` ordinal (`deco`) dates, because they are similar to [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#:~:text=ISO%208601%20is%20an%20international%20standard%20covering%20the%20worldwide%20exchange%20and%20communication%20of%20date%20and%20time%2Drelated%20data.) [ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Ordinal_dates) (`isoo`) dates. Like `isoo` dates, `deco` dates consist of a year and a day-of-the-year (`doty`).

`Doty` values (`doties`) in `Decalendar` dates count the number of days that have passed since March 1, which is `Day` `0` in `Decalendar`, and can optionally include a `Dec` clock (`Declock`) time. The timestamp in the navbar of my blog is an example of a `Decalendar` date combined with a `Declock` time.

The navbar timestamp is also derived from millisecond UNIX time, which I obtained in `time.js` by calling `Date.now()`. In essence, all three of the scripts in @exm-date convert millisecond UNIX time into a `deco` date or timestamp.

While `time.js` is sourced by Quarto when it reads the HTML block in each of my blog `.qmd` files, `date.lua` is run as a [Pandoc filter](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/filters.html) during the creation of the output `.html` files, and `date.py` is executed as a [post-render script](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html#pre-and-post-render). @exm-date speaks to the power and versatility of Quarto.

Coming up next on my blog is [a post](../observable/observable.qmd) that introduces `Dec` with [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) graphics. Get ready for an animated and interactive data visualization extravaganza!
