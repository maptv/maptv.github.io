## What is an action potential?

- A **rapid, temporary change in membrane potential**
- Allows neurons to communicate over long distances
- All-or-none: same size every time once threshold is reached

---

## Big Picture: Why Action Potentials Matter

- Thought 🧠
- Movement 💪
- Sensation 👁️
- Homeostasis ⚖️

Without action potentials, the nervous system cannot function.

## How Long Are Human Nerves?

- The **longest axons** (e.g., from spinal cord to toes) can be **~1–1.5 meters** long

### Orders of Magnitude (Length)

| Example | Approx. Length |
|------|---------------|
| Bacterium | ~1 µm (10⁻⁶ m) |
| Human cell | ~10 µm (10⁻⁵ m) |
| **Longest human axon** | **~1 m (10⁰ m)** |
| Football field | ~100 m (10² m) |

➡️ One neuron can span **100,000× the size of a typical cell**.

---

## How Fast Are Action Potentials?

- Speed depends on axon diameter and myelination
- **Human cortex**: ~1–5 m/s
- **Large myelinated axons**: up to **120 m/s**

---

## Orders of Magnitude: Speed

| Example | Speed |
|------|------|
| Snail | ~0.01 m/s |
| Walking human | ~1.4 m/s |
| **Cortical action potential** | **~1–5 m/s** |
| Olympic sprinter | ~10 m/s |
| Commercial jet | ~250 m/s |

Neurons aren’t that fast—but they’re fast enough to think, react, and survive.

## Electrical Units: Membrane Potential

- Measured in **millivolts (mV)**
- Inside of neuron is negative relative to outside

### Typical Values

| State | Membrane Potential |
|------|-------------------|
| Resting | −70 mV |
| Threshold | −55 mV |
| Peak | +30 mV |

---

## Orders of Magnitude: mV vs Batteries

| Source | Voltage |
|------|--------|
| Neuron membrane change | ~100 mV (0.1 V) |
| AA battery | 1.5 V |
| Phone battery | ~3.7 V |

➡️ A neuron works with **tiny voltages**, yet produces powerful effects.

---

## Neurons as Social Networks

- A single neuron can form **1,000–10,000 synaptic connections**

### Comparison

| Network | Typical Connections |
|-------|--------------------|
| Average social media user | ~150–500 friends |
| Influencer | ~10⁵–10⁶ followers |
| **Neuron** | **up to 10⁴ synapses** |

➡️ Your brain is a **biological super-network**.

## Concentration Gradients

- Ions move **down their concentration gradients**
- High → low concentration

Key ions:

- **Na⁺**: high outside
- **K⁺**: high inside

Gradients store **potential energy**.

---

## Resting Membrane Potential

Maintained by:

- Unequal ion distribution
- Selective membrane permeability
- **Na⁺/K⁺ pump**
  - Pumps **3 Na⁺ out**
  - Pumps **2 K⁺ in**

Result: neuron rests at **~ −70 mV**.

---

## Stages of an Action Potential

1. Resting state
2. Depolarization
3. Repolarization
4. Hyperpolarization

Each stage depends on **voltage-gated ion channels**.

---

## Depolarization: Sodium Channels

- Voltage-gated **Na⁺ channels open** at threshold
- Na⁺ rushes **into** the neuron
- Membrane potential becomes positive

➡️ Rising phase of the action potential

---

## Repolarization: Potassium Channels

- Na⁺ channels inactivate
- Voltage-gated **K⁺ channels open**
- K⁺ flows **out** of the neuron

➡️ Membrane potential returns toward negative

---

## Hyperpolarization

- K⁺ channels close slowly
- Membrane becomes **more negative than rest**

This is why neurons cannot fire continuously.

---

## Refractory Periods

### Absolute Refractory Period

- No new action potential possible
- Na⁺ channels are inactivated

### Relative Refractory Period

- Stronger stimulus required
- Membrane is hyperpolarized

➡️ Ensures **one-way signal travel** and limits firing rate.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Action potentials are rapid electrical signals
- Tiny voltages, long distances, fast speeds
- Ion gradients + voltage-gated channels make it possible
- Your brain is one of the most complex networks in the universe
