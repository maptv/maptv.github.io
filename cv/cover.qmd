I am writing to express my interest in the Azure Data Engineer position at Accenture Federal Services. With a career spanning biomedical science, machine learning, health data analytics, and cloud engineering, I am confident that my blend of leadership experience, technical expertise, and mission-driven focus aligns well with the role’s demands and Accenture’s public service vision.

Throughout my career, I have led interdisciplinary teams focused on turning complex health data into actionable insights. As a Senior Domain Lead at Amazon Web Services, I worked with many scientists who wanted to integrate cloud-based tools into their workflows and transfer their computational workloads to the cloud. As an AI Engineering Manager at Booz Allen Hamilton, I led teams developing cyber intelligence and COVID-19 analytics solutions, obtaining the Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Associate certification in the process.

Prior to that, I spent over a decade at the National Institutes of Health integrating clinical, genomic, and imaging data to develop therapeutic and diagnostic strategies, where I mentored undergraduate, graduate, and medical school students. In addition to mentoring students, I have taught computer and data science courses at the Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences, George Washington University, General Assembly, Data Society, and Virginia Tech.

What draws me to Accenture Federal Services is your mission to support national health and safety through cutting-edge technology. I am passionate about using data science to solve complex public health challenges, and I thrive in fast-paced environments that demand both strategic oversight and hands-on execution.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and dedication to your team. I am happy to provide further information or schedule a conversation at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Martin Skarzynski Laptev PhD MPH MS
