I am writing to express my interest in the Data Scientist position at Accenture Federal Services (AFS). With a career spanning biomedical science, machine learning, health data analytics, and cloud engineering, I am confident that my blend of leadership experience, technical expertise, and mission-driven focus aligns well with the role’s demands and AFS’s public service vision.

Throughout my career, I have led interdisciplinary teams focused on turning complex data into actionable insights. As a Senior Domain Lead at Amazon Web Services, I worked with many scientists who wanted to integrate cloud-based tools into their workflows and transfer their computational workloads to the cloud. As an AI Engineering Manager at Booz Allen Hamilton, I led teams developing cyber intelligence and COVID-19 analytics solutions, obtaining the Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Associate certification in the process.

Prior to that, I spent over a decade at the National Institutes of Health integrating clinical, genomic, and imaging data to develop therapeutic and diagnostic strategies, where I mentored undergraduate, graduate, and medical school students. In addition to mentoring students, I have taught computer and data science courses at the Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences, George Washington University, General Assembly, Data Society, and Virginia Tech.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my experience and dedication to your team. I am happy to provide further information or to answer any questions that you might have.

Sincerely,

Martin Skarzynski Laptev PhD MPH MS
