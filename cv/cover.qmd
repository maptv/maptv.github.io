I am writing to express my interest in the Staff Data Scientist position at K1X. With over a decade of experience designing and deploying end-to-end Artifical Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions, I am excited by the prospect of contributing to K1X’s AI-powered platform for alternative investments.

My background includes building large-scale AI, ML, and NLP systems that extract and interpret unstructured data—especially in high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare. At Amazon Web Services (AWS), I served as a Senior Domain Lead, helping enterprise clients design and deploy scalable architectures using SageMaker, Lambda, and other AWS services. These engagements often involved parsing unstructured documents, which directly aligns with K1X’s core challenge of extracting and categorizing data from complex PDF tax documents.

Previously at Booz Allen Hamilton, I led interdisciplinary teams to deliver NLP-powered applications in cybersecurity and public health. One of my key strengths is bridging the gap between data science and business needs—translating technical insight into strategic impact for stakeholders at all levels. I also hold three AWS certifications, including Solutions Architect Associate, underscoring my fluency in modern cloud infrastructure.

Beyond applied machine learning, I am deeply committed to education and mentorship. I have trained enterprise teams at Data Society and General Assembly on topics such as NLP, ML Operations (MLOps), and Generative AI. I have also taught graduate-level courses at Virginia Tech and George Washington University. These roles have sharpened my ability to mentor junior data scientists and foster a collaborative, learning-driven environment.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills and experiences align with this role and the ways I can support K1X's vision and bring value to your growing team.

Sincerely,

Martin Skarzynski Laptev
