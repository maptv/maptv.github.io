I am writing to apply for the Biology (Microbiology) Adjunct Faculty Position at the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC). With a PhD in Tumor Biology from Georgetown University, an MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics from Johns Hopkins University, and over a decade of teaching and biomedical research experience, I would like to use my scientific expertise and pedagogical skills to help CCBC students succeed in the sciences.

Throughout my career, I have worked on interdisciplinary teams focused on turning complex data into actionable insights. As a Senior Domain Lead at Amazon Web Services, I collaborated with cloud, data, and machine learning engineers to empower scientists who wanted to integrate cloud-based tools into their workflows and transfer their computational workloads to the cloud. As an AI Engineering Manager at Booz Allen Hamilton, I led teams developing cyber intelligence and COVID-19 analytics solutions, obtaining the Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Associate certification in the process.

Most recently, I taught graduate courses in data analytics and machine learning at Virginia Tech. I also taught undergraduate courses in biology and leadership at George Washington University. At the National Institutes of Health, I conducted cancer immunology and genomics research, mentored trainees from NIH programs (SIP, MRSP, HiSTEP), and taught many bioinformatics and biotechnology courses through FAES. Beyond higher education, I have designed and led training programs for enterprise and community learners through General Assembly and Data Society.

These roles honed my ability to inspire curiosity, support diverse learners, and foster critical thinking in classroom and laboratory settings. I am especially drawn to the unique educational opportunities that CCBC provides. I am committed to employing and refining best practices in teaching, supporting scientific literacy, and making a positive impact on future science and healthcare workers. With my interdisciplinary expertise, I am eager to contribute to curriculum development, student mentoring, and departmental service at CCBC.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background in biomedical research and teaching can contribute to the success of CCBC.

Sincerely,

Martin Skarzynski Laptev PhD MPH MS
