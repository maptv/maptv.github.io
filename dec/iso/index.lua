-- My website serves as a demonstration of both the
-- [Quarto](https://quarto.org) publishing system and the [Dec](../../dec)
-- measurement system. I use several clever hacks to get Quarto to display
-- all of the dates on my website in the Dec `year+day` format. If you are
-- not interested in Dec dates, you may want to skip to the section on
-- Quarto [filters](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/filters.html),
-- [render
-- scripts](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html#pre-and-post-render),
-- and [include
-- files](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#includes).
--
-- ### Dec dates
--
-- The `year+day` format of Dec dates is derived from the year of the era
-- equation:
-- $\colorbox{yellow}{y}{=}\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor{+}\colorbox{cyan}{d}{\div}\colorbox{orange}{n}$.
-- In this equation, $\colorbox{yellow}{y}$ is the decimal years since the
-- Dec epoch (Year 0 <span class="blue" data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
-- data-bs-title="March 1"><u>Day 0</u></span>),
-- $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor$ is $\colorbox{yellow}{y}$
-- [floored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions#:~:text=the%20greatest%20integer%20less%20than%20or%20equal%20to%20x)
-- to obtain an
-- [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer#:~:text=the%20number%20zero%20%280%29%2C%20a%20positive%20natural%20number%20%281%2C%202%2C%203%2C%20.%20.%20.%29%2C%20or%20the%20negation%20of%20a%20positive%20natural%20number%20%28%E2%88%921%2C%20%E2%88%922%2C%20%E2%88%923%2C%20.%20.%20.%29)
-- year, $\colorbox{cyan}{d}$ is the
-- [zero-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering#:~:text=a%20way%20of%20numbering%20in%20which%20the%20initial%20element%20of%20a%20sequence%20is%20assigned%20the%20index%C2%A00)
-- day of the year, and $\colorbox{orange}{n}$ is the total number of days
-- in the year.
--
-- Dec dates only include the first two terms from the equation above
-- ($\colorbox{yellow}{y}$ and $\colorbox{cyan}{d}$), because
-- $\colorbox{orange}{n}$ is not needed to identify a specific date in
-- time, only has 2 possible values (365 or 366), remains constant for long
-- periods of time (366, 1095, or 2920 days), and can be calculated using
-- the Dec year length equation:
--
-- $$\colorbox{orange}{n}=\begin{cases}
--   366&{\begin{align}\text{if } (\lfloor \colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor+1)\text{ \% }4=0\\
--   \land(\lfloor \colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor+1)\text{ \% }100\neq0\\
--   \lor(\lfloor \colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor+1)\text{ \% }400=0\end{align}}\\\\
--   365&{\text{otherwise.}}\end{cases}$$
--
-- In the Dec year length equation, `%` is the
-- [modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo#:~:text=returns%20the%20remainder)
-- operator, $\land$ is the logical
-- [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction)
-- operator, and $\lor$ is the logical
-- [disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction)
-- operator, and $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor{+}1$ is the subsequent
-- year. The easiest way to explain this equation is in terms of the
-- [Gregorian
-- calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#:~:text=the%20calendar%20used%20in%20most%20parts%20of%20the%20world):
-- the length of a Dec year is 366 days if the subsequent year is a
-- Gregorian calendar [leap
-- year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#:~:text=Every%20year%20that%20is%20exactly%20divisible%20by%20four%20is%20a%20leap%20year%2C%20except%20for%20years%20that%20are%20exactly%20divisible%20by%20100%2C%20but%20these%20centurial%20years%20are%20leap%20years%20if%20they%20are%20exactly%20divisible%20by%20400)
-- and 365 days otherwise.
--
-- Dec dates look almost identical to [ISO
-- 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#:~:text=an%20international%20standard%20covering%20the%20worldwide%20exchange%20and%20communication%20of%20date%20and%20time%2Drelated%20data)

-- calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#:~:text=the%20calendar%20used%20in%20most%20parts%20of%20the%20world),
-- but any calendar with fixed rules can be turned in a Dec calendar
-- (Decalendar) by expressing its dates as zero-based moving its starting
-- point ().
--
-- with simple arithmetic, Decalendar is
-- [perennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_calendar#:~:text=applies%20to%20any%20year%2C%20keeping%20the%20same%20dates),

-- dates Dec addresses the two major flaws of the by moving the start of
-- the year to March 1. When Leap Day is the last day of the year, the day
-- numbers (indexes) used by Decalendar remain constant year to year.
-- Starting the year on March 1 also brings Decalendar in better alignment
-- with the [metereological
-- seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season#:~:text=meteorological%20seasons%20are%20reckoned%20by%20temperature%2C%20with%20summer%20being%20the%20hottest%20quarter%20of%20the%20year%20and%20winter%20the%20coldest%20quarter%20of%20the%20year).
--
-- Dec dates overcome several major flaws with the Gregorian calendar. The
-- `day` in `year+day` dates is referred to as the ‚Äúday of the year‚Äù or
-- doty.
--
-- a single number that can identify specific days of the year (like months
-- and days of the month) and coordinate schedules of work and rest days
