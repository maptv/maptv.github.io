My website serves as a demonstration of both the [Quarto](https://quarto.org) publishing system and the [Dec](/dec) measurement system. I use several clever hacks to get Quarto to display all of the dates on my website in the Dec [year]{.yellow}+[day]{.cyan} format. Knowing the basics of Dec dates will help you to understand the Quarto [filter](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/filters.html), [render script](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html#pre-and-post-render), and [include file](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#includes) examples in my [Quarto article](/software/quarto).

Among its many features, Quarto offers support for the [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) data analysis and visualization system. In the Observable [calendar🗓️plots](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot-calendar)
below, [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#:~:text=the%20calendar%20used%20in%20most%20parts%20of%20the%20world) months are identified by [color](https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-schemes) and each day of the year has its own [cell](https://observablehq.com/plot/marks/cell). Despite these similarities, the two plots illustrate how the Dec (top) and Gregorian (bottom) calendars differ.

The Dec calendar (Decalendar) starts on [Day 0]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="March 1"} instead of [Day 306]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="January 1"} and uses groups of 10 days called deks in place of weeks and days of the dek (dotd) in lieu of days of the week. When combined, a dek and dotd form a Dec day of the year (doty).
The current doty is \${styledDecoDoty}. The doty selected by the [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) [range🎚️inputs](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/input-range)
above and highlighted in the calendar plots is \${styledDotyInput}.

The Play▶️button above cycles🔄through
every doty, month, and day of the month value so that each day gets its turn to be highlighted with a red🟥background. The [toggle✅input](https://observablehq.com/framework/inputs/toggle#:~:text=choose%20one%20of%20two%20values) next to the button determines whether the plots show a leap ([n]{.orange}=366) or a common ([n]{.orange}=365) year. The [radio🔘input](https://observablehq.com/framework/inputs/radio#:~:text=choose%20one%20of%20a%20given%20set%20of%20values) beneath the toggle input sets the day of the week on [Day 306]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="January 1"}.

The Gregorian calendar [changes every year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_calendar#:~:text=a%20representation%20of%20the%20year%20that%20expires%20with%20the%20year%20represented) to adapt to the days of the week. In contrast, Decalendar [remains the same every year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_calendar#:~:text=a%20calendar%20that%20applies%20to%20any%20year) except leaps years. The addition of [Day 365]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="February 29"} to leap years shifts 306 Gregorian calendar dates forward by one day, but does not affect the order of Dec dates, because [Day 365]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="February 29"} is the last day of Dec leap years.

Even though Dec does not use weeks, Dec dates can be modified to include [POSIX weekday numbers](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/utilities/date.html#:~:text=weekday%20as%20a%20decimal%20number%20%5B0%2C6%5D%20(0%3Dsunday)). The current Dec date, \${styledDecoYear}+\${styledDecoDoty1}, can be converted into the current day of the week (dotw) date, \${styledDecoYear1}\${dotw0sign}\${styledDotw0doty}+\${styledDotw}, by separating the current doty, \${styledDecoDoty2}, into the doty of the first day of the current week, \${styledDotw0doty1}, and the current POSIX weekday number: \${styledDotw1}.

leaving the addition of the difference and the POSIX weekday number, , [unsolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_solving#:~:text=to%20solve%20an%20equation%20is%20to%20find%20its%20solutions).

Dec dotw dates can be further modified to include [POSIX week numbers](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/utilities/date.html#:~:text=week%20of%20the%20year%20(sunday%20as%20the%20first%20day%20of%20the%20week)%20as%20a%20decimal%20number%20%5B00%2C53%5D.%20all%20days%20in%20a%20new%20year%20preceding%20the%20first%20sunday%20shall%20be%20considered%20to%20be%20in%20week%200.). To find the current Dec week number, , we add the POSIX weekday number of Day 0, , to the current doty and [floor divide]() by 7. To convert the current Dec week date, , into a normal Dec date, we subtract the POSIX weekday number of Day 0: 7*U+w-w=d.

Following the Dec week date pattern, we can adapt Dec dates to use any other fixed-length calendar unit, including the 20-day [dudek](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dudek#Esperanto:~:text=dudek-,twenty,-Polish%5Bedit), 30-day [tridek](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tridek#Esperanto:~:text=tridek-,thirty,-Categories%3A), 40-day [kvardek](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kvardek#Esperanto:~:text=kvardek-,forty,-Categories%3A), or 73-day [sepdektri](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sepdek_tri#Esperanto:~:text=sepdek%20tri-,seventy%2Dthree,-Categories%3A). No other calendar unit can be as convenient as the 10-day [dek](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dek#Esperanto:~:text=dek-,ten%20(10),-Derived%20terms%5B), because our [decimal numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal#:~:text=system%20for%20denoting%20integer%20and%20non%2Dinteger%20numbers) allows us to naturally combine a dek and a day of the dek into a single number.

Dec can also be modified to display Dec month numbers and [POSIX day of the month (dotm) numbers](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904875/utilities/date.html#:~:text=day%20of%20the%20month%20as%20a%20decimal%20number%20%5B01%2C31%5D). The current Dec month date is |y|+d-m+m. We represent the current month with the last doty of the previous month because POSIX dotm numbers are one-based. If we represent the current month with its first doty, we have to use a zero-based dotm number: |y|+d-m+m.

We can combine the patterns above to create hybrid Dec day of the month and week (dotmaw) dates. The current Dec dotmaw date, |y|+d-m-w+m+w, Of course, this is getting a bit complicated and more than a bit silly, but Dec meek dates can be convenient if you want both the dotm and the dotw. To go back to a normal Dec date… you guessed it… we solve for the doty: d-m-w+m+w=d. 

Essentially, you can show whatever number(s) you want to show as part of a Dec date. All it takes is a little bit of arithmetic! All of the math above may have lead you to the conclusion that Dec dates have a mathematical basis. Indeed, all of the date formats above have their own equations.

Also, the Gregorian calendar varies greatly depending on the days of the week. In total, there are 14 different Gregorian calendar variants that repeat in a [400-year cycle]().

The `year+day` format is based on the Dec date equation: $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor{+}\colorbox{cyan}{d}{\div}\colorbox{orange}{n}{=}\colorbox{yellow}{y}$, where $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor{+}\colorbox{cyan}{d}$ is the Dec date, $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor$ is the year obtained by [flooring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions#:~:text=the%20greatest%20integer%20less%20than%20or%20equal%20to%20x) $\colorbox{yellow}{y}$, the [decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal#:~:text=denoting%20integer%20and-,non%2Dinteger%20numbers,-.%20It%20is%20the) years that have passed since the Dec [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch#:~:text=an%20instant%20in%20time%20chosen%20as%20the%20origin%20of%20a%20particular%20calendar%20era) ([Year 0]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="1 BC"} [Day 0]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="March 1"} [Dot 0]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="midnight"}), $\colorbox{cyan}{d}$ is the [zero-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering#:~:text=a%20way%20of%20numbering%20in%20which%20the%20initial%20element%20of%20a%20sequence%20is%20assigned%20the%20index%C2%A00) day of the year, and $\colorbox{orange}{n}$ is the number of days in $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor$. The Dec date equation for today is \${styledDecoYear}+\${styledDecoDoty1}÷\${styledNdays}=\${styledFracYear}.

Dec dates only include the first two terms from the [left-hand side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sides_of_an_equation#:~:text=the%20expression%20on%20the%20left%20of%20the%20%22%3D%22%20is%20the%20left%20side%20of%20the%20equation) of the Dec date equation: $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor$ and $\colorbox{cyan}{d}$. The right-hand side of the equation, $\colorbox{yellow}{y}$, can also be used as a date. We need $\colorbox{orange}{n}$ to calculate $\colorbox{yellow}{y}$ via the Dec date equation above and to obtain $\colorbox{cyan}{d}$ using the Dec day of the year equation: $\colorbox{cyan}{d}{=}\colorbox{yellow}{y}\vcenter{\text{\%}}1{\times}\colorbox{orange}{n}$. In simple terms, $\colorbox{cyan}{d}$ is the [decimal part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_part#:~:text=the%20excess%20beyond%20that%20number%27s%20integer%20part) of $\colorbox{yellow}{y}$ multiplied by $\colorbox{orange}{n}$.

To find $\colorbox{orange}{n}$, we plug $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor$ into the Dec year length equation below, where
$\vcenter{\text\%}$ is the [modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo#:~:text=returns%20the%20remainder) operator, $\land$ is the logical [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction) operator (and), and $\lor$ is the logical [disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction) operator (or). According to this equation, $\colorbox{orange}{n}$ is 366 if the subsequent year [(Year $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor{+}1$)]{.nowrap} is a [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#:~:text=the%20calendar%20used%20in%20most%20parts%20of%20the%20world) [leap year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#:~:text=Every%20year%20that%20is%20exactly%20divisible%20by%20four%20is%20a%20leap%20year%2C%20except%20for%20years%20that%20are%20exactly%20divisible%20by%20100%2C%20but%20these%20centurial%20years%20are%20leap%20years%20if%20they%20are%20exactly%20divisible%20by%20400) and 365 if Year $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor{+}1$ is a Gregorian calendar [common year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_year#:~:text=a%20calendar%20year%20with%20365%20days).


$$\colorbox{orange}{n}=\begin{cases}
  366&{\begin{align}\text{if } (\lfloor \colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor+1)\vcenter{\text{ \% }}4=0\\
  \land(\lfloor \colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor+1)\vcenter{\text{ \% }}100\neq0\\
  \lor(\lfloor \colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor+1)\vcenter{\text{ \% }}400=0\end{align}}\\\\
  365&{\text{otherwise.}}\end{cases}$$

In addition to calculating $\colorbox{yellow}{y}$, $\colorbox{orange}{n}$ is needed to convert between `year+day` and `year-day` Dec dates. The `year-day` version of the Dec date equation is $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor{+}1{-}(\colorbox{cyan}{d}{-}\colorbox{orange}{n}){\div}\colorbox{orange}{n}{=}\colorbox{yellow}{y}$. In essence, $\colorbox{cyan}{d}{-}\colorbox{orange}{n}$ is a ["T-minus" countdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown#:~:text=backward%20counting%20to%20indicate%20the%20time%20remaining%20before%20an%20event) of the days until the start of Year $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor{+}1$. The current `year-day` date, \${styledNextYear}-\${styledDecoTminus}, tells us that Year \${nextYear} will begin in \${Tminus} days.

The difference between $\colorbox{cyan}{d}$ and $\colorbox{cyan}{d}{-}\colorbox{orange}{n}$ can also be explained in terms of computer programming. If we think of years as [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure)#Element_identifier_and_addressing_formulas:~:text=a%20data%20structure%20consisting%20of%20a%20collection%20of%20elements%20(values%20or%20variables)%2C%20of%20same%20memory%20size%2C%20each%20identified%20by%20at%20least%20one%20array%20index), $\colorbox{cyan}{d}$ and $\colorbox{cyan}{d}{-}\colorbox{orange}{n}$ are like array [indexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure)#Element_identifier_and_addressing_formulas:~:text=individual%20objects%20are%20selected%20by%20an%20index) that can be used to identify array elements or combine them via [slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_slicing#:~:text=an%20operation%20that%20extracts%20a%20subset%20of%20elements%20from%20an%20array). In this analogy, $\colorbox{cyan}{d}$ is a [positive index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering#:~:text=a%20way%20of%20numbering%20in%20which%20the%20initial%20element%20of%20a%20sequence%20is%20assigned%20the%20index%C2%A00) with a range of $0$ to $\colorbox{orange}{n}{-}1$ and $\colorbox{cyan}{d}{-}\colorbox{orange}{n}$ is a [negative index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_slicing#:~:text=specify%20an%20offset%20from%20the%20end%20of%20the%20array) that ranges from ${-}\colorbox{orange}{n}$ to ${-}1$.

We can express the [bounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_and_lower_bounds#:~:text=an%20upper%20bound%20or%20majorant%5B1%5D%20of%20a%20subset%20S%20of%20some%20preordered%20set%20(K%2C%20%E2%89%A4)%20is%20an%20element%20of%20K%20that%20is%20greater%20than%20or%20equal%20to%20every%20element%20of%20S.%5B2%5D%5B3%5D%20Dually%2C%20a%20lower%20bound%20or%20minorant%20of%20S%20is%20defined%20to%20be%20an%20element%20of%20K%20that%20is%20less%20than%20or%20equal%20to%20every%20element%20of%20S) for $\colorbox{cyan}{d}$ values with the [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)#:~:text=the%20set%20of%20all%20real%20numbers%20lying%20between%20two%20fixed%20endpoints) $\left [0,\colorbox{orange}{n} \right )$, the [inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_(mathematics)#:~:text=a%20non%2Dequal%20comparison) $0{\le}\colorbox{cyan}{d}{\lt} \colorbox{orange}{n}$, or the Dec range $0{=}$. Similarly, the analogous interval, inequality, and Dec range for $\colorbox{cyan}{d}{-}\colorbox{orange}{n}$ are $[{-}\colorbox{orange}{n},0)$, ${-}\colorbox{orange}{n}{\le}\colorbox{cyan}{d}{-}\colorbox{orange}{n}{\lt}0$, and ${-}\colorbox{orange}{n}{=}$, respectively.


Even though it only uses years and days, Dec can display dates based on months or weeks by modifying $\colorbox{cyan}{d}$.
The equation for Dec week dates is $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor{+}7{\times}\colorbox{pink}{U}{+}\text{\textcolor{blue}{w}}{-}\text{\textcolor{blue}{w}}_
\text{\textcolor{blue}{d=0}}{=}\colorbox{yellow}{y}$, where $\colorbox{pink}{U}$ is the week number, $\text{\textcolor{blue}{w}}$ is the day of the week number, and $\text{\textcolor{blue}{w}}_\text{\textcolor{blue}{d=0}}$ is $\text{\textcolor{blue}{w}}$ on the first day of the year ($\colorbox{cyan}{d}{=}0$). The Dec week date equation for today is .

We can truncate the Dec week date equation to remove $\text{\textcolor{blue}{w}}_\text{\textcolor{blue}{d=0}}$, which can be determined from $\lfloor\colorbox{yellow}{y}\rfloor$ and is not needed to identify a date. The truncated Dec week date equation for today is .

If we ever need to convert between a doty and a Gregorian calendar month and day of the month without any conversion tools, we can use the Dec finger mnemonic, which is similar to the [knuckle mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckle_mnemonic#:~:text=a%20mnemonic%20device%20for%20remembering%20the%20number%20of%20days%20in%20the%20months%20of%20the%20Julian%20and%20Gregorian%20calendars). The numbers above the fingers in the image below indicate the doty of the last day of each Gregorian calendar month. The thumb, middle finger, and pinky represent months with 31 days, whereas the index and ring fingers stand for 30-day months.

![Dec finger mnemonic](/asset/finger.svg){.knitr}

The [southward equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_equinox#:~:text=the%20moment%20when%20the%20Sun%20appears%20to%20cross%20the%20celestial%20equator%2C%20heading%20southward) falls on Day 205 in Year 2024, 2025, 2028, and 2029. We can determine that Day 205 is September 22 by subtracting the Dec date of the last day of August (Day 183), the month preceding September, from the southward equinox doty: $205{-}183{=}22$. To convert in the other direction, we would sum the doty and the day of the month: $183{+}22{=}205$.

The finger mnemonic highlights a major difference between Dec and the Gregorian calendar: the Dec year starts on [Day 0]{.underline .blue data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="March 1"} just like the [Roman calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar#:~:text=the%20calendar%20used%20by%20the%20Roman%20Kingdom%20and%20Roman%20Republic), the predecessor of the Gregorian and Julian calendars. For this reason, the Latin [numeral prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_prefix#:~:text=prefixes%20derived%20from%20numerals) in the names of the months of [Septem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_prefix#:~:text=7-,septem,-%2D%2C%20septi%2D%5B)ber, [Octo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_prefix#:~:text=8-,octo,-%2D%5Bu)ber, [Novem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_prefix#:~:text=9-,novem,-%2D%5Bx)ber, and [Decem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_prefix#:~:text=10-,decem,-%2D%2C%20dec%2D%5B)ber match their one-based indexes (7, 8, 9, and 10) in Dec and the Roman calendar, but not in the Julian or Gregorian calendars.

The knuckle and finger mnemonics attempt to make sense of the irregular pattern of month lengths in the Gregorian calendar. Rather than replace variable-length months with [fixed-length months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_reform#13-month_calendars), Dec forgoes the use of months entirely and instead uses groups of ten days called deks.
