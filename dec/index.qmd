# Dec measurement system {.hiddenheading #dec}

This section of my website focuses on Dec, a [measurement system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_units_of_measurement#:~:text=a%20collection%20of%20units%20of%20measurement%20and%20rules%20relating%20them%20to%20each%20other) that [I](https://maptv.github.io) created. All Dec measurements are based on [turns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_%28angle%29#:~:text=a%20unit%20of%20plane%20angle%20measurement%20equal%20to%202%CF%80%C2%A0radians%2C%20360%C2%A0degrees) (t). When measuring [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle#:~:text=the%20figure%20formed%20by%20two%20rays)📐, t represents a full⭕️circle and equals 2$\pi$ ([$\underline\tau$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_%28angle%29#:~:text=the%20Greek%20letter,to%20one%20turn)) [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian#:~:text=the%20unit%20of%20angle%20in%20the%20International%20System%20of%20Units) (rad) or 360 [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#:~:text=a%20measurement%20of%20a%20plane%20angle%20in%20which%20one%20full%20rotation%20is%20360%20degrees) (°). Dec measures distance in turns called [taurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)#Tau_proposals:~:text=%E2%81%A0%20turn-,Circumference%20of%20a%20circle,-%F0%9D%90%B6) (c) and tracks time with two other types of turns: years (y) and days (d).

The three turn types that Dec uses for distance and time measurement are all approximations of physical attributes of the Earth🌍: c $\approx$ the [circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_circumference#:~:text=the%20distance%20around%20Earth) of the Earth🌏, y $\approx$ the duration of [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit#:~:text=From%20a%20vantage%20point%20above%20the%20north%20pole%20of%20either%20the%20Sun%20or%20Earth%2C%20Earth%20would%20appear%20to%20revolve%20in%20a%20counterclockwise%20direction%20around%20the%20Sun) of the Earth🌎around the Sun☀️, and d $\approx$ the duration of [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation#:~:text=the%20rotation%20of%20planet%20Earth%20around%20its%20own%20axis) of the Earth🌍on its [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#:~:text=the%20imaginary%20line%20that%20passes%20through%20both%20the%20north%20pole%20and%20south%20pole). Notably, $\text c\over\text d$ = [v = ωr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity#:~:text=linear%20velocity%20is%20the%20radius%20times%20the%20angular%20velocity) $\approx$ the speed of the rotation of Earth🌏at the [Equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator#:~:text=the%20circle%20of%20latitude%20that%20divides%20Earth%20into%20the%20Northern%20and%20Southern%20hemispheres).

## Longitude latitude course {.hiddenheading #llc}

The table below provides the current [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude#:~:text=a%20geographic%20coordinate%20that%20specifies%20the%20east%2Dwest%20position%20of%20a%20point%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20the%20Earth) ([$\lambda$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude#:~:text=denoted%20by%20the%20Greek%20letter%20lambda)) in [milli[parallels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_latitude#:~:text=an%20abstract%20east%E2%80%93west%20small%20circle%20connecting%20all%20locations%20around%20Earth%20(ignoring%20elevation)%20at%20a%20given%20latitude%20coordinate%20line)]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a circle of latitude"} (m$\lambda$) and [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#:~:text=a%20geographic%20coordinate%20that%20specifies%20the%20north%2Dsouth%20position%20of%20a%20point%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20the%20Earth) ([$\phi$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#:~:text=denoted%20by%20the%20Greek%20lower%2Dcase%20letter%20phi)) in [milli[meridians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_arc#Full_meridian_(polar_perimeter):~:text=The%20polar%20Earth%27s%20circumference%20is%20simply%20four%20times%20quarter%20meridian)]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a polar circumference"} (m$\phi$) of Points [0]{.point0} and [1]{.point1} on the map🗺️beneath the table. By default, [Point 0]{.point0} is at [800]{.color8} m$\lambda$ and [0]{.color0} m$\phi$, near the [Galápagos🏝️archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands#:~:text=an%20archipelago%20of%20volcanic%20islands%20in%20the%20Eastern%20Pacific) of Ecuador🇪🇨, and [Point 1]{.point1} is at [800]{.color8} m$\lambda$ and [100]{.color1} m$\phi$, in the United States🇺🇸city of [Memphis, Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee#:~:text=a%20city%20in%20the%20U.S.%20state%20of%20Tennessee).

To move the points, click the map🗺️or edit their coordinates in the table. The [Observable](https://observablehq.com) [toggle](https://observablehq.com/framework/inputs/toggle)✅inputs above the table add layers to the map🗺️: country borders, a rainbow🌈colored🎨grid of Dec [graticules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graticule_(cartography)#:~:text=a%20graphical%20depiction%20of%20a%20coordinate%20system%20as%20a%20grid%20of%20lines), a [choropleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map#:~:text=a%20type%20of%20statistical%20thematic%20map%20that%20uses%20pseudocolor) of [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time#:~:text=the%20primary%20time%20standard%20globally%20used%20to%20regulate%20clocks%20and%20time) time zones, and [solar terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(solar)#:~:text=a%20moving%20line%20that%20divides%20the%20daylit%20side%20and%20the%20dark%20night%20side%20of%20a%20planetary%20body) shading with a yellow🟡dot denoting that the Sun☀️is [directly overhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsolar_point#:~:text=the%20point%20at%20which%20its%20Sun%20is%20perceived%20to%20be%20directly%20overhead) at \${sunLonHsl} m$\lambda$ and \${sunLatHsl} m$\phi$.

Each row of the table contains the geographic coordinates of a point and the [course](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_(navigation)#:~:text=the%20cardinal%20direction%20in%20which%20the%20craft%20is%20to%20be%20steered) ([$\alpha$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth#:~:text=%20azimuth%20is%20usually%20denoted%20alpha)) in [milli[windroses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_rose#:~:text=a%20polar%20diagram%20displaying%20the%20orientation%20of%20the%20cardinal%20directions)]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a compass rose"} (m$\alpha$) we would need to maintain to travel🧳the shortest distance to the other point. The default courses in m$\alpha$ are [0]{.color0} (North) from [Point 0]{.point0} to [Point 1]{.point1} and [500]{.color5} (South) from [Point 1]{.point1} to [Point 0]{.point0}. By default, the points are [100]{.color1} [millitaurs]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a taur"} (mc) apart.

An airplane✈️flying at [500]{.color5} [milliomegars]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of the equatorial speed of rotation of Earth"} ([mv]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of the equatorial speed of rotation of Earth on its axis"}), half the equatorial speed of the rotation of Earth🌎on its axis, could travel🧳the [100]{.color1} mc between the default positions📍of Points [0]{.point0} and [1]{.point1} in [200]{.color2} [millidays]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a day"} ([md]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a day"}). To get the time in days (d) required to travel🧳between two points, we divide the distance in mc by the speed in [mv]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of the equatorial speed of rotation of Earth on its axis"}: \${distance_mtaur} mc &divide; \${travelspeed} [mv]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of the equatorial speed of rotation of Earth on its axis"} = \${(distance_mtaur / travelspeed).toFixed(3)} d.

The [color🎨wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel#:~:text=an%20abstract%20illustrative%20organization%20of%20color%20hues%20around%20a%20circle) [compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass#:~:text=a%20device%20that%20shows%20the%20cardinal%20directions%20used%20for%20navigation%20and%20geographic%20orientation)🧭above indicates both a [hue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue#:~:text=an%20angular%20position%20around%20a%20central%20or%20neutral%20point%20or%20axis%20on%20a%20color%20space%20coordinate%20diagram) and a course. We can express the hue in [HSL and HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#:~:text=the%20two%20most%20common%20cylindrical%2Dcoordinate%20representations%20of%20points%20in%20an%20RGB%20color%20model) degrees (h°) and convey the course in compass🧭degrees (c°): 25 m$\alpha$ = 9 c°. To rotate🔄the color🎨wheel compass🧭, use the Observable hue [range](https://observablehq.com/framework/inputs/range)🎚️and hue [bar](https://observablehq.com/@paavanb/progressive-color-picker)📊inputs beneath it or change the course from [Point 0]{.point0} to [Point 1]{.point1} on the map🗺️.

## Red green blue (rgb) {.hiddenheading #rgb}

Together, the [milliturn]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a thousandth of a turn"} (mt) values of the range🎚️inputs beneath the hue bar📊inputs form a hue saturation lightness (hsl) triplet that, like a red🔴green🟢blue🔵([rgb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model#:~:text=an%20additive%20color%20model)) or [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet:~:text=hexadecimal%20number%20used%20in%20HTML%2C%20CSS%2C%20SVG%2C%20and%20other%20computing%20applications%20to%20represent%20colors) (hex) triplet, specifies a color🎨. The table underneath the range🎚️inputs compares the current [Point 0]{.point0} to [Point 1]{.point1} course in its top row with the [cardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction#:~:text=north%2C%20south%2C%20east%2C%20and%20west) and [intercardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction#:~:text=northeast%20(NE)%2C%20southeast%20(SE)%2C%20southwest%20(SW)%2C%20and%20northwest%20(NW)) directions.

Color🎨can provide a general sense of angular📐[measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle#:~:text=The%20magnitude%20of%20an%20angle), regardless of the [metric prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix#:~:text=a%20unit%20prefix%20that%20precedes%20a%20basic%20unit%20of%20measure%20to%20indicate%20a%20multiple%20or%20submultiple%20of%20the%20unit) or [units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle#Units) we use. Therefore, we can reuse♻️colors🎨across many different contexts. Typically, starting points are red: North ([0]{.color0} m$\alpha$), [Longitude 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18th_meridian_west#:~:text=a%20line%20of%20longitude%20that%20extends%20from%20the%20North%20Pole%20across%20the%20Arctic%20Ocean%2C%20Greenland%2C%20Iceland%2C%20the%20Atlantic%20Ocean%2C%20the%20Canary%20Islands%2C%20the%20Southern%20Ocean%2C%20and%20Antarctica%20to%20the%20South%20Pole) ([0]{.color0} m$\lambda$), and midnight ([0]{.color0} [md]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a day"}), and midpoints are cyan: South ([500]{.color5} m$\alpha$), [Longitude 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/162nd_meridian_east#:~:text=a%20line%20of%20longitude%20that%20extends%20from%20the%20North%20Pole%20across%20the%20Arctic%20Ocean%2C%20Asia%2C%20the%20Pacific%20Ocean%2C%20the%20Southern%20Ocean%2C%20and%20Antarctica%20to%20the%20South%20Pole) ([500]{.color5} [m$\lambda$]{.tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="milliparallel"}), and noon ([500]{.color5} [md]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a day"}).

The Equator, also known as Latitude 0, is the [major latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_latitude#:~:text=mark%20the%20divisions%20between%20the%20five%20principal%20geographical%20zones) midway between the South ([-250]{.color750} m$\phi$) and North ([250]{.color250} m$\phi$) Pole.
The other four major latitudes depend on the [axial tilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#Earth:~:text=the%20angle%20between%20the%20ecliptic%20and%20the%20celestial%20equator%20on%20the%20celestial%20sphere) of the Earth🌏([65]{.color065} mt): the Tropics of [Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer#:~:text=northernmost%20circle%20of%20latitude%20where%20the%20Sun%20can%20be%20seen%20directly%20overhead)♋([65]{.color065} m$\phi$) and [Capricorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Capricorn#:~:text=the%20southernmost%20latitude%20where%20the%20Sun%20can%20be%20seen%20directly%20overhead)♑️([-65]{.color935} m$\phi$), and the [Arctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle#:~:text=the%20southernmost%20latitude%20at%20which%2C%20on%20the%20winter%20solstice%20in%20the%20Northern%20Hemisphere%2C%20the%20Sun%20does%20not%20rise%20all%20day%2C%20and%20on%20the%20Northern%20Hemisphere%27s%20summer%20solstice%2C%20the%20Sun%20does%20not%20set) ([250]{.color250} m$\phi$ -- [65]{.color065} m$\phi$ = [185]{.color185} m$\phi$) and [Antarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circle#:~:text=the%20Sun%20is%20above%20the%20horizon%20for%2024%20continuous%20hours%20at%20least%20once%20per%20year%20(and%20therefore%20visible%20at%20solar%20midnight)%20and%20the%20centre%20of%20the%20Sun%20(ignoring%20refraction)%20is%20below%20the%20horizon%20for%2024%20continuous%20hours%20at%20least%20once%20per%20year%20(and%20therefore%20not%20visible%20at%20solar%20noon)) ([65]{.color065} m$\phi$ -- [250]{.color250} m$\phi$ = [-185]{.color815} m$\phi$) Circles.

Notably, Longitude 0 is the major longitude that serves as the Dec [Prime Meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian#:~:text=an%20arbitrarily%2Dchosen%20meridian%20%28a%20line%20of%20longitude%29%20in%20a%20geographic%20coordinate%20system%20at%20which%20longitude%20is%20defined%20to%20be%200%C2%B0) and the [International Date Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Date_Line#:~:text=the%20line%20between%20the%20South%20and%20North%20Poles%20that%20is%20the%20boundary%20between%20one%20calendar%20day%20and%20the%20next).

Like the ten major longitudes that separate them, Dec time zones are numbered [0]{.color0} to [9]{.color9}. The number assigned to each time zone is its offset from Zone [0]{.color0}. Dec offsets are positive integer [decidays]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="tenths of a day"} ([dd]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="deciday"}). To obtain the offset at a location, we [floor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions#:~:text=the%20greatest%20integer%20less%20than%20or%20equal%20to%20x) its d$\lambda$ longitude: ⌊d$\lambda$⌋. Based on its current d$\lambda$ longitude, ${point0lHsl}, [Point 0]{.point0} on the map🗺️above is in Zone ${point0zHsl}.

Each Dec time zone is one [deciparallel]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a tenth of a circle of latitude"} (d$\lambda$) wide and half of a meridian ($\phi$) long. While one $\phi$ is always about one c long, the length of a parallel ($\lambda$) [varies by latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude#Length_of_a_degree_of_longitude:~:text=depends%20only%20on%20the%20radius%20of%20a%20circle%20of%20latitude). At the Equator, one $\lambda$ is roughly one c long. At the [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole#:~:text=the%20point%20in%20the%20Northern%20Hemisphere%20where%20the%20Earth%27s%20axis%20of%20rotation%20meets%20its%20surface) or [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole#:~:text=the%20point%20in%20the%20Southern%20Hemisphere%20where%20the%20Earth%27s%20axis%20of%20rotation%20meets%20its%20surface) Pole, the length of $\lambda$ is zero. In general, the approximate length of a parallel is the [cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_and_cosine#:~:text=the%20ratio%20of%20the%20length%20of%20the%20adjacent%20leg%20to%20that%20of%20the%20hypotenuse) of its $\phi$ latitude: cos(\${parLat}) = \${parLen}.

## Coordinated Universal Time {.hiddenheading #utc}

[UTC time zone offsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset#:~:text=the%20difference%20in%20hours%20and%20minutes%20between%20Coordinated%20Universal%20Time%20(UTC)%20and%20the%20standard%20time%20at%20a%20particular%20place) range from \${rainbowN5zn} to \${rainbowP583} [dd]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="deciday"}. According to your web browser, your UTC offset is \${utcOffHslM} &div; 144 = \${utcOffHslD} [dd]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="deciday"}. The Dec time zone that corresponds to your UTC offset is Zone \${decZonHslP}. This Dec time zone is \${utcOffDiff} [dd]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="deciday"} \${utcOffDiff < 0 ? "behind" : "ahead"} of time zones with your UTC offset. The times in corresponding Dec and UTC time zones can differ by up to 0.5 [dd]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="deciday"}.

We can obtain the time in Zone [0]{.color0} by subtracting the offset of any time zone from its time. Inversely, we can get the time in any time zone by adding its offset to the Zone [0]{.color0} time. The date and time are the exact same in Zone [0]{.color0} and [UTC[+00:00]{.color0}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B00:00#:~:text=the%20basis%20of%20Coordinated%20Universal%20Time). Zone [5]{.color5} and [UTC[+12:00]{.color5}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B12:00) have the exact same date and time, both are exactly one day ahead of [UTC[-12:00]{.color5}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9212:00).

To avoid date mismatches with UTC time zones that have negative offsets, we can subtract ten dd from any positive Dec offset to make it negative. This way each Dec time zone has both a positive and a negative offset. When we add an offset of \${decZonHslN} dd to the current date and time in Zone [0]{.color0}, we get \${decYearHsl}+\${decDateHsl} as the date and \${decTimeHsl}\${decSign}\${decZonHslA} as the time.

We can apply color🎨labels🏷️based on [millimillennia]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a millennium"} (mk) and [milliyears]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a year"} (my) to Dec dates in the year+day format. Every year starts on [Day 0]{.underline .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="March 1"} ([0]{.color0} my). The midyear point ([500]{.color5} my) is noon of [Day 182]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="August 30"} in common years and midnight of [Day 183]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="August 31"} in leap years. Every millennium starts with Year 0 ([0]{.color0} mk) and has Year 500 ([500]{.color5} mk) as its midpoint.

# Zone equatorial meter (zem) {#zem}

Apart from c, Dec also measures distance using a unit called the **z**one **e**quatorial **m**eter (zem). The width of a Dec time zone at the Equator is approximately ten million (~10^7^) zems. Similarly, the distance from the Equator to one of the Poles is ~10^7^ [meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#Definition:~:text=the%20base%20unit%20of%20length%20in%20the%20International%20System%20of%20Units). In other words, a [decimeridian]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a tenth of a polar circumference"} (d$\phi$) is ~10^7^ zems long and a [quarter meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_arc#Full_meridian_(polar_perimeter):~:text=The%20distance%20from%20the%20equator%20to%20the%20pole) is ~10^7^ meters long.

You can measure a square zem yourself with a ruler📏or measuring tape. Either sitting in a chair🪑or standing🧍, measure 1 z, 4 dm, or 16 inches between knees and your feet🦶. This distance may be more or less the width of your hips or shoulders. Next, measure this same distance down from your knees to create the left and right sides of the square🔲.

If two people sit facing each other with their legs🦵bent at 25 [centiturn]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a hundredth of a turn"} (ct) angles and their knees 1 z apart, there will be around a cubic zem of space between their legs🦵. According to [dimensions.com](https://www.dimensions.com), 115 [centizems]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="hundredths of a zem"} (cz) is the [typical seat height](https://www.dimensions.com/element/sitting-female-side-1#:~:text=Seat%20Height%20(Typical)%3A-,18%E2%80%9D%20%7C%2046%20cm,-Style%3A%20Casual) and 95 cz is a [low seat height](https://www.dimensions.com/element/sitting-female-front-1#:~:text=Seat%20Height%20(Low)%3A-,15%E2%80%9D%20%7C%2038%20cm,-Style%3A%20Casual) for both men and women age 25 to 45. A [centizem]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a hundredth of a zem"} is 4 [millimeters]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a meter"} (mm).

In [Slovak](https://sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zem)🇸🇰, zem means Earth🌏. This is fitting because all Dec units are based on physical properties of the Earth🌎. At the Equator, the Earth🌍rotates on its axis at a speed of 1.00224 v. If we could indefinitely maintain this speed while flying West in an airplane✈️towards the setting sun☀️, we would be able to perpetually fly [into the sunset](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidingIntoTheSunset)🌅.

## Speed of sound {.hiddenheading #sos}

To travel fast enough, the airplane✈️would need to surpass the [speed of sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound#:~:text=the%20distance%20travelled%20per%20unit%20of%20time%20by%20a%20sound%20wave)🔊: 0.735048 v or Mach 1. [Mach numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number) are similar to v, but are relative to the speed of sound🔊rather than the equatorial speed of rotation of the Earth🌏. One v is Mach 1.3635. A useful point of reference is the cruising speed of a [Boeing 747](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747#:~:text=sweep%2C%20allowing%20a-,Mach%C2%A00.85,-%28490%C2%A0kn;%20900): 0.54 v or Mach 0.85.

The highway🛣️speed of a car🚗is roughly tenfold slower than the cruising speed of airplane✈️. If we are driving on a highway🛣️at 50 mv and our exit is 1000 zems away, we will have 20 [centimillidays]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="hundred thousandths of a day"} until we have to exit the highway🛣️. To ensure we do not miss our exit, we can periodically check a countdown of the remaining zem: \${zLeft}.

In Dec, centimillidays are called beats because they are similar in duration to heart❤️beats or musical🎵beats. A beat is [864]{.color864} milliseconds. One mc is a hundred thousand (10^5^) zem (z) and one day (d) is 10^5^ beats (b). Therefore, 1 mv = $\text{mc}\over\text d$ = $\text z\over\text b$. It is easy to convert z into meters (m), z = $2\over5$ m, or mv into kilometers per hour (kmph): mv = $5\over3$ kmph.

The table below shows the [United States (US) customary units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_and_US_customary_measurement_systems) that Dec redefines based on the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#:~:text=the%20world%27s%20most%20widely%20used%20system%20of%20measurement) (SI). The measurements in each row are equal. The values in the first column are [fold changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_change#:~:text=measure%20describing%20how%20much%20a%20quantity%20changes%20between%20an%20original%20and%20a%20subsequent%20measurement) from original to redefined units. A fold change of [1]{.color0} indicates no change. Units that are derived in the same way have the same fold change.

## Zem conversion table {.hiddenheading #zct}

{{< include /dec/_kegtable.qmd >}}

Instead of metric prefixes based on [powers of ten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_10#:~:text=any%20of%20the%20integer%20powers%20of%20the%20number%20ten), redefined units rely on [fractions based on powers of two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic_rational#:~:text=a%20fraction%20whose%20denominator%20is%20a%20power%20of%20two) to scale up or down as needed. Redefined units serve as convenient reference points and can easily be converted to Dec or SI units. Miles are redefined such that one Dec mile per hour is one [mv]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="millitaurs per day"}. A Dec acre is equal to $2\over5$ [hectares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare#:~:text=10%2C000%20square%20metres) or 40 [are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare#Are:~:text=area%2C%20equal%20to-,100%20square%20metres).

A square zem (z^2^) is 1 [hexamilliare]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="1.6 thousandths of an are"} (x), 16 square [decimeters]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="tenths of a meter"} (dm^2^), 1.[7]{style="text-decoration-line:overline;"} Dec square feet🦶, or 256 Dec square inches. A square [decazem]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="ten zem"} (Dz^2^) is 1 [hexadeciare]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="sixteen hundredths of an are"}, 16 square meters (m²), 19.753086 Dec square yards, or 100 x.

A cubic [decizem]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a tenth of a zem"} (dz^3^) is 1 shot, 2 Dec ounces, or 64 [milliliters]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a liter"} (mL). A shot of water🌊weighs 64 grams (g). Even though the weight of a Dec ounce of water🌊is close to a sixteenth of a Dec pound, Dec does not measure weights in ounces. A cubic zem (z^3^) is 1 keg, 16 Dec gallons, or 64 [liters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre#:~:text=is%20equal%20to-,1%20cubic%20decimetre,-(dm3)%2C%201000%20cubic) (L).

A BMI above 4.8 $\text {kg}\over\text z^2$ or 30 $\text {kg}\over\text m^2$ is considered [obese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity#:~:text=person's%20height—is-,over%2030%C2%A0kg/m2,-;%20the%20range%2025).

# Summary{#tldr}

This article introduces the Dec measurement system and describes how Dec uses the properties of the planet Earth🌎and metric prefixes to define units based on turns for geographic coordinates, compass🧭directions, colors🎨, speeds, dates, times, time zones, distances, areas, volumes, and weights. Many Dec measurements The introduction includes a comparison of Dec, SI, and US customary units.
