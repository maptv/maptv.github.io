# Dec {.hiddenheading}

This section of my website focuses on Dec, a [measurement system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_units_of_measurement#:~:text=a%20collection%20of%20units%20of%20measurement%20and%20rules%20relating%20them%20to%20each%20other) that [I](https://maptv.github.io) created. All Dec measurements are based on [turns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_%28angle%29#:~:text=a%20unit%20of%20plane%20angle%20measurement%20equal%20to%202%CF%80%C2%A0radians%2C%20360%C2%A0degrees) (t). When measuring [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle#:~:text=the%20figure%20formed%20by%20two%20rays)📐, t represents a full⭕️circle and equals 2$\pi$ ([$\underline\tau$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_%28angle%29#:~:text=the%20Greek%20letter,to%20one%20turn)) [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian#:~:text=the%20unit%20of%20angle%20in%20the%20International%20System%20of%20Units) (rad) or 360 [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#:~:text=a%20measurement%20of%20a%20plane%20angle%20in%20which%20one%20full%20rotation%20is%20360%20degrees) (°). Dec measures distance📏in turns called [taurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)#Tau_proposals:~:text=%E2%81%A0%20turn-,Circumference%20of%20a%20circle,-%F0%9D%90%B6) (c) and tracks time⏳with two other types of turns: years (y) and days (d).

The three turn types that Dec uses for distance📏and time⏳measurement are all approximations of physical attributes of the Earth🌍: c $\approx$ the [circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_circumference#:~:text=the%20distance%20around%20Earth) of the Earth🌏, y $\approx$ the duration of [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit#:~:text=From%20a%20vantage%20point%20above%20the%20north%20pole%20of%20either%20the%20Sun%20or%20Earth%2C%20Earth%20would%20appear%20to%20revolve%20in%20a%20counterclockwise%20direction%20around%20the%20Sun) of the Earth🌎around the Sun☀️, and d $\approx$ the duration of [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation#:~:text=the%20rotation%20of%20planet%20Earth%20around%20its%20own%20axis) of the Earth🌍on its [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#:~:text=the%20imaginary%20line%20that%20passes%20through%20both%20the%20north%20pole%20and%20south%20pole). Notably, $\text c\over\text d$ = [v = ωr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity#:~:text=linear%20velocity%20is%20the%20radius%20times%20the%20angular%20velocity) $\approx$ the speed of the rotation of Earth🌏at the [Equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator#:~:text=the%20circle%20of%20latitude%20that%20divides%20Earth%20into%20the%20Northern%20and%20Southern%20hemispheres).

The table below⬇️provides the current [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude#:~:text=a%20geographic%20coordinate%20that%20specifies%20the%20east%2Dwest%20position%20of%20a%20point%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20the%20Earth) ([$\lambda$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude#:~:text=denoted%20by%20the%20Greek%20letter%20lambda)) in [milli[parallels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_latitude#:~:text=an%20abstract%20east%E2%80%93west%20small%20circle%20connecting%20all%20locations%20around%20Earth%20(ignoring%20elevation)%20at%20a%20given%20latitude%20coordinate%20line)]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a circle of latitude"} (m$\lambda$) and [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#:~:text=a%20geographic%20coordinate%20that%20specifies%20the%20north%2Dsouth%20position%20of%20a%20point%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20the%20Earth) ([$\phi$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#:~:text=denoted%20by%20the%20Greek%20lower%2Dcase%20letter%20phi)) in [milli[meridians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_arc#Full_meridian_(polar_perimeter):~:text=The%20polar%20Earth%27s%20circumference%20is%20simply%20four%20times%20quarter%20meridian)]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a polar circumference"} (m$\phi$) of Points [0]{.point0} and [1]{.point1} on the map🗺️beneath the table. By default, [Point 0]{.point0} is at [800]{.point0} m$\lambda$ and [0]{.point0} m$\phi$, which is near the [Galápagos🏝️archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands#:~:text=an%20archipelago%20of%20volcanic%20islands%20in%20the%20Eastern%20Pacific) of Ecuador🇪🇨, and [Point 1]{.point1} is at [800]{.point1} m$\lambda$ and [100]{.point1} m$\phi$, which is in the United States🇺🇸city of [Memphis, Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee#:~:text=a%20city%20in%20the%20U.S.%20state%20of%20Tennessee).

In the table, the geographic coordinates of each point are followed by the [course](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_(navigation)#:~:text=the%20cardinal%20direction%20in%20which%20the%20craft%20is%20to%20be%20steered) ([$\alpha$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth#:~:text=%20azimuth%20is%20usually%20denoted%20alpha)) in [milli[windroses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_rose#:~:text=a%20polar%20diagram%20displaying%20the%20orientation%20of%20the%20cardinal%20directions)]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a compass rose"} (m$\alpha$) we would need to maintain to travel🧳the shortest distance📏to the other point on the map🗺️. The default courses in m$\alpha$ are [0]{.point0} (North) from [Point 0]{.point0} to [Point 1]{.point1} and [500]{.point1} (South) from [Point 1]{.point1} to [Point 0]{.point0}. By default, the points are 100 [millitaurs]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a taur"} (mc) apart.

Click the map🗺️to move the points. To return the points to their original positions📍, click the "Reset" button above the table. Next to the "Reset" button, there are [toggle](https://observablehq.com/framework/inputs/toggle)✅inputs that add country borders, a grid of Dec [graticules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graticule_(cartography)#:~:text=a%20graphical%20depiction%20of%20a%20coordinate%20system%20as%20a%20grid%20of%20lines), [solar terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(solar)#:~:text=a%20moving%20line%20that%20divides%20the%20daylit%20side%20and%20the%20dark%20night%20side%20of%20a%20planetary%20body) shading, a yellow🟡dot denoting where the Sun☀️is directly overhead (\${Math.floor(long2turn(sun[0]))} m$\lambda$, \${Math.floor(lati2turn(sun[1]))} m$\phi$), and [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time#:~:text=the%20primary%20time%20standard%20globally%20used%20to%20regulate%20clocks%20and%20time) time zones.

An airplane✈️flying at 500 [milliomegars]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of the circumference of Earth"} (mv), half the equatorial speed of the rotation of Earth🌎on its axis, could travel🧳the 100 mc between the default positions📍of Points [0]{.point0} and [1]{.point1} in 200 [millidays]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a day"} (md). To get the time in days (d) required to travel🧳between two points, we divide the distance📏in mc by the speed in mv: \${distance_mtaur} mc &divide; \${travelspeed} mv = \${(distance_mtaur / travelspeed).toFixed(3)} d.

[Orange]{.orange} you glad I couldn't think of a color🎨pun?
:::

The range🎚️inputs beneath the color🎨wheel compass🧭represent a hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) triplet that specifies a color with three [milliturn]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a thousandth of a turn"} (mt) values. We can convert the hue mt value into compass🧭degrees (c°) and [HSL and HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#:~:text=the%20two%20most%20common%20cylindrical%2Dcoordinate%20representations%20of%20points%20in%20an%20RGB%20color%20model) hue degrees (h°). We can also translate an HSL triplet into an HSV, [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model#:~:text=an%20additive%20color%20model), or [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet:~:text=hexadecimal%20number%20used%20in%20HTML%2C%20CSS%2C%20SVG%2C%20and%20other%20computing%20applications%20to%20represent%20colors) (hex) triplet.

Color🎨can provide a general sense of angular📐[measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle#:~:text=The%20magnitude%20of%20an%20angle), regardless of the [metric prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix#:~:text=a%20unit%20prefix%20that%20precedes%20a%20basic%20unit%20of%20measure%20to%20indicate%20a%20multiple%20or%20submultiple%20of%20the%20unit) or [units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle#Units) we use. Therefore, we can reuse♻️colors🎨across many different contexts. In any context, starting points are red: North ([0]{.color0} m$\alpha$), [Longitude 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18th_meridian_west#:~:text=a%20line%20of%20longitude%20that%20extends%20from%20the%20North%20Pole%20across%20the%20Arctic%20Ocean%2C%20Greenland%2C%20Iceland%2C%20the%20Atlantic%20Ocean%2C%20the%20Canary%20Islands%2C%20the%20Southern%20Ocean%2C%20and%20Antarctica%20to%20the%20South%20Pole) ([0]{.color0} m$\lambda$), and midnight ([0]{.color0} md); midpoints are cyan: South ([500]{.color5} m$\alpha$), [Longitude 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/162nd_meridian_east#:~:text=a%20line%20of%20longitude%20that%20extends%20from%20the%20North%20Pole%20across%20the%20Arctic%20Ocean%2C%20Asia%2C%20the%20Pacific%20Ocean%2C%20the%20Southern%20Ocean%2C%20and%20Antarctica%20to%20the%20South%20Pole) ([500]{.color5} ml), and noon ([500]{.color5} md).

Apart from m$\alpha$, m$\lambda$, and md, we can apply color🎨labels🏷️based on [milliyears]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a year"} (my) and [millimillennia]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a millennium"} (mk). Every year (y) starts on [Day 0]{.underline .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="March 1"} ([0]{.color0} my). The midyear point ([500]{.color5} my) is noon of [Day 182]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="August 30"} in common years and midnight of [Day 183]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="August 31"} in leap years. Every millennium (k) starts with Year 0 ([0]{.color0} mk) and has Year 500 ([500]{.color5} mk) as its midpoint.

The Equator, also known as Latitude 0, is the midpoint between the South ([-250]{.color75} m$\phi$) and North ([250]{.color25} m$\phi$) Pole. When the “Grid” toggle✅input is enabled, Latitudes [-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_parallel_south#:~:text=a%20circle%20of%20latitude%20that%20is%2072%20degrees%20south%20of%20the%20Earth's%20equatorial%20plane%20in%20the%20Antarctic) ([-200]{.color8} m$\phi$), [-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36th_parallel_south#:~:text=a%20circle%20of%20latitude%20that%20is%2036%20degrees%20south%20of%20the%20Earth's%20equatorial%20plane) ([-100]{.color9} m$\phi$), 0 ([0]{.color0} m$\phi$), [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36th_parallel_north#:~:text=a%20circle%20of%20latitude%20that%20is%2036%20degrees%20north%20of%20the%20Earth's%20equatorial%20plane) ([100]{.color1} m$\phi$), and [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_parallel_north#:~:text=a%20circle%20of%20latitude%20that%20is%2072%20degrees%20north%20of%20the%20Earth's%20equatorial%20plane%2C%20in%20the%20Arctic) ([200]{.color2} m$\phi$) are shown on the map🗺️above⬆️along with the ten major longitudes that divide the Earth🌍into the ten Dec time zones.

Like the ten major longitudes that separate them, Dec time zones are numbered [0]{.color0} to [9]{.color9}. The number assigned to each time zone is its offset from Zone [0]{.color0}. Dec offsets are positive integer [decidays]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="tenths of a day"} ([dd]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="deciday"}). To obtain the offset at a location, we [floor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions#:~:text=the%20greatest%20integer%20less%20than%20or%20equal%20to%20x) its d$\lambda$ longitude: ⌊d$\lambda$⌋. Based on its current d$\lambda$ longitude, ${point0lHsl}, [Point 0]{.point0} on the map🗺️above⬆️is in Zone ${point0zHsl}.

# UTC {.hiddenheading}

[UTC time zone offsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset#:~:text=the%20difference%20in%20hours%20and%20minutes%20between%20Coordinated%20Universal%20Time%20(UTC)%20and%20the%20standard%20time%20at%20a%20particular%20place) range from \${rainbowN5zn} to \${rainbowP583} [dd]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="deciday"}. According to your web browser, your UTC offset is \${utcOffHslM} &div; 144 = \${utcOffHslD} [dd]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="deciday"}. The Dec time zone that corresponds to your UTC offset is Zone \${decZonHslP}. This Dec time zone is \${utcOffDiff} [dd]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="deciday"} \${utcOffDiff < 0 ? "behind" : "ahead"} of time zones with your UTC offset. The times in corresponding Dec and UTC time zones can differ by up to 0.5 [dd]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="deciday"}.

To obtain the time in Zone [0]{.color0}, we can subtract the offset of any time zone from its time. Inversely, we can get the time in any time zone by adding its offset to the Zone [0]{.color0} time. The date and time are the exact same in Zone [0]{.color0} and [UTC[+00:00]{.color0}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B00:00#:~:text=the%20basis%20of%20Coordinated%20Universal%20Time). Zone [5]{.color5} and [UTC[+12:00]{.color5}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B12:00) have the exact same date and time, both are exactly one day ahead of [UTC[-12:00]{.color5}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9212:00).

To avoid date mismatches with UTC time zones that have negative offsets, we can subtract ten dd from any positive Dec offset to make it negative. This way each Dec time zone has both a positive and a negative offset. When we add an offset of \${decZonHslN} dd to the current date and time in Zone [0]{.color0}, we get \${decYearHsl}+\${decDateHsl} as the date and \${decTimeHsl}\${decSign}\${decZonHslA} as the time.

Each Dec time zone is one [deciparallel]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a tenth of a circle of latitude"} (d$\lambda$) wide and half of a meridian ($\phi$) long. While one $\phi$ is always about one c long, the length of a parallel ($\lambda$) [varies by latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude#Length_of_a_degree_of_longitude:~:text=depends%20only%20on%20the%20radius%20of%20a%20circle%20of%20latitude). At the Equator, one $\lambda$ is roughly one c long. At the [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole#:~:text=the%20point%20in%20the%20Northern%20Hemisphere%20where%20the%20Earth%27s%20axis%20of%20rotation%20meets%20its%20surface) or [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole#:~:text=the%20point%20in%20the%20Southern%20Hemisphere%20where%20the%20Earth%27s%20axis%20of%20rotation%20meets%20its%20surface) Pole, the length of $\lambda$ is zero. In general, the approximate length of a parallel is the [cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_and_cosine#:~:text=the%20ratio%20of%20the%20length%20of%20the%20adjacent%20leg%20to%20that%20of%20the%20hypotenuse) of its $\phi$ latitude: cos(\${parLat}) = \${parLen}.

# Zem {.hiddenheading}

Apart from c, Dec also measures distance📏using a unit called the **z**one **e**quatorial **m**eter (zem). The width of a Dec time zone at the Equator is roughly ten million (~10^7^) zems. Similarly, the distance📏from the Equator to one of the Poles is ~10^7^ [meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#Definition:~:text=the%20base%20unit%20of%20length%20in%20the%20International%20System%20of%20Units). In other words, a [decimeridian]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a tenth of a polar circumference"} (d$\phi$) is ~10^7^ zems long and a [quarter meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_arc#Full_meridian_(polar_perimeter):~:text=The%20distance%20from%20the%20equator%20to%20the%20pole) is ~10^7^ meters long.

One c is a hundred million (10^8^) zems or forty million (4 &times; 10^7^) meters. A zem is 10 [nanotaurs]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="billionths of a taur"} (nc) or 0.4 ($2\over5$) meters. A meter is 25 nc or 2.5 ($5\over2$) zems. One mv is equal to one zem per [centimilliday]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a hundred thousandth of a day"}. In Dec, a centimilliday is called a beat because it is similar in duration to a heart❤️beat or musical🎵beat. One mc is 10^5^ zem and a day is 10^5^ beats.

In [Slovak](https://sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zem)🇸🇰, zem means Earth🌏. This is fitting because all Dec units are based on physical properties of the Earth🌎. At the Equator, the Earth🌍rotates on its axis at a speed of 1.00224 v. If we could indefinitely maintain this speed while flying West in an airplane✈️while the sun☀️was setting, we would be able to perpetually fly [into the sunset](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidingIntoTheSunset)🌅.

To reach the necessary speed, the airplane✈️would need to surpass the [speed of sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound#:~:text=the%20distance%20travelled%20per%20unit%20of%20time%20by%20a%20sound%20wave)🔊: 0.735048 v or Mach 1. [Mach numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number) are similar to v, but are relative to the speed of sound🔊instead of the equatorial speed of rotation of the Earth. One v is Mach 1.3635. A useful point of reference is the cruising speed of a [Boeing 747](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747#:~:text=sweep%2C%20allowing%20a-,Mach%C2%A00.85,-%28490%C2%A0kn;%20900): 0.54 v or Mach 0.85.

If we are driving a car on a highway at a speed of 50 mv and our exit is 1000 zems away, we will have to exit the highway in 20 beats: 1000 zems &divide; 50 mv = 20 beats.

Apart from distance measurements, zem are also useful for measuring speed. zem is to an mc as centimilliday is to a day.

The Zone [8]{.color8} to [0]{.color0} conversion calculations are ${decTimeZn8} -- [8]{.color8} = , ${decTimeZn8} + [8]{.color8} = . Inversely, we can get the time in any time zone by adding either one of its offset to the Zone [0]{.color0} time. The Zone [0]{.color0} to [8]{.color8} conversion calculations are ${decTimeZn8} -- [8]{.color8} = , ${decTimeZn8} + [8]{.color8} = . 

Of the two possible results, we can pick the one that is within the typical bounds for a Dec time: 0 <= time < 10.

The time zone By default, Points [0]{.point0} and [1]{.point1} on the map🗺️above⬆️lie on [Longitude 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90th_meridian_west#:~:text=a%20line%20of%20longitude%20that%20extends%20from%20the%20North%20Pole%20across%20the%20Arctic%20Ocean%2C%20North%20America%2C%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Mexico%2C%20Central%20America%2C%20the%20Pacific%20Ocean%2C%20the%20Southern%20Ocean%2C%20and%20Antarctica%20to%20the%20South%20Pole) (\${rainbowMer8}  m$\lambda$), the start of Zone [8]{.color8}. To obtain the time in Zone [0]{.color0}, we can subtract either the positive or negative offset of Zone [8]{.color8} from its time: 

and make 

At least one of the two kinds of offsets will result in 


The time zone conversion calculations for Zone [8]{.color8} are 

We can choose the offset based on whether we want the resulting time to be positive or negative. In Zone [0]{.color0}, the positive time is currently \${decTimeZ0n} and the current negative time is \${decTimeZ0p}

In Dec, negative times are perfectly valid, but only positive times are shown by default.  Negative times tell us how much of the day is left, instead of how much of the day has passed. Positive and negative times are two sides of the same coin🪙. At noon, half of the day has passed and half is left, just like a glass🥃can be both half full and half empty.

To convert between positive and negative times, we can add and subtract ten dd as needed.

In contrast, dates are impacted by our choice of a positive or negative offset. Positive offset dates are one day ahead of their negative counterparts.

The date in Zone \${rainbow8zn4} is \${decDateHsl} if we use its positive offset and \${decYestHsl} otherwise. By providing a positive and negative offset for each time zone, Dec can match the date in any UTC time zone.



Dates calculated using negative offsets will be This may be useful avoid date mismatches between Dec time zones that overlap with negative thus can be roughly one day ahead of their geographically closest UTC analogs. Zone \${rainbow6zon}, the default time of Points \${rainbow9zon} are .

unless we subtract ten dd to make their offsets negative. The width of a UTC time zone is often 41.[6]{style="text-decoration-line:overline;"} m$\lambda$, but ranges from 0 m$\lambda$ to the width of China🇨🇳: [424](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_China#:~:text=109%C2%B056%E2%80%B2E-,West,-%3A%20Akto%20County) m$\lambda$ -- [254](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_China#:~:text=%20%5Bcitation%20needed%5D-,East,-%3A%20Fuyuan%20County%2C%20Heilongjiang%2C%20on) m$\lambda$ = 170 m$\lambda$.



To accomodate negative UTC offsets, we can make any Dec offset negative by subtracting ten.

The Dec time zone that corresponds to your UTC offset is Zone \${decZone1st}. 

If you UTC offset is negative, To match the date in negative UTC zones, we can substract



Each offset has a negative form that yields the same time but on a date that is one day earlier. To obtain the time in Zone \${rainbow0zn1} ($t_0$), we can subtract the offset ($o_x$) of any time zone $x$ from its deciday time ($t_x$): $t_0$ = $t_x$ -- $o_x$. Inversely, we can get the time in any time zone by adding its offset to the Zone \${rainbow0zn2} time. If $t_x$ is less than $o_x$, then $t_0$ will be negative: $t_x$ < $o_x \rightarrow t_0$ < $0$.

We can add ten to any negative deciday time become positive.

Instead of adding ten to a negative difference, we can subtract a the negative version of the offset
In Dec, both times and offsets can be negative. Positive times tell us how much of the day has passed and negative times let us know how much of the day is left. Converting between positive and negative times or offsets is as easy as subtracting or adding ten. Negative offsets can facilitate mental calculations
We can subtract ten from a time zone number to get a negative time zone offset. 

Both positive and negative offsets yield the correct time, but negative offsets result in a date that is one day behind the correct date produced by positive offsets.

To measure time, Dec uses years and days. Years are turns of a celestial body around [the point it orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter_%28astronomy%29#:~:text=the%20point%20about%20which%20the%20bodies%20orbit).

The ISO🌐8601 [time⏳interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals:~:text=the%20intervening%20time%20between%20two%20time%20points) from now until midnight can be expressed without including the current time as , which is equivalent to the Dec span🌈.

ISO🌐8601 and Dec are  different objectives. ISO🌐8601 seeks to standardize how we measure time, whereas Dec aims to completely redefine how we measure time.


Unlike ISO🌐8601, the documentation describing Dec is available for free under a [Creative Commons license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#:~:text=one%20of%20several%20public%20copyright%20licenses%20that%20enable%20the%20free%20distribution%20of%20an%20otherwise%20copyrighted%20%22work%22). While ISO🌐8601 standardizes,

 can be split two components: the Dec calendar🗓️(Decalendar) and clock🕓(Declock).
The year in Dec is the same as in the
Dec counts🧮years and days as integers and fractions. In Dec, the [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal#:~:text=the%20integer%20written%20to%20the%20left%20of%20the%20decimal%20separator) and [fractional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_part#:~:text=the%20excess%20beyond%20that%20number%27s%20integer%20part) part of a year form a date, while the fractional part of a year. The fractional years are expressed by  while [fractional days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time#Fractional_days) are . since the Dec [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch#:~:text=an%20instant%20in%20time%20chosen%20as%20the%20origin%20of%20a%20particular%20calendar%20era), Dec tracks the date as and the time of day as fractional days using a single number called the [doy]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="day-of-year"}.
In essence, Decalendar and Declock  count🧮fractions of a year and a day, respectively. The numerator and denominator for Decalendar is the number of days in the year, and the Declock denominator is $10^x$, where $x$ is the number of digits in the numerator. In both systems, only the numerator, not the denominator, is provided. In the context of Decalendar, the numerator is the days that have passed in the year, while in the context of Declock, the numerator is the parts of the day that have passed in the day.

To avoid any confusion between the two, we can say [Day 5]{.underline .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="March 6"} to mean the date when 5 days have passed this year or [Day 0]{.underline .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="March 1"} to mean the first day-of-year ([doy]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="day-of-year"}). This is like the use of the term "day zero" in other contexts, such as epidemiology. The analogous term for times is "Dot". The word "Dot" conveys that at its core Declock is a system built on [fractional days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time#Fractional_days) expressed as decimal numbers. The 5 in "Dot 5" can be thought of as a number after a decimal (0.5) or a numerator (⁵/₁₀), either way it means noon, the time when half the day has passed.

The analogy to decimals or fractions is important, because it explains why adding a zero at the end of a time does not change the time, only the implied tolerance of time points or the implied duration of time intervals. If Dot 5 is a time point, it has an implied tolerance of 5% of the day ($.5±.05$), because any time after Dot 45 and before Dot 55 ($[.45, .55)$) would round to Dot 5. On the other hand, if Dot 5 is the start time for a time interval, that interval is implied to start at Dot 5 and end before Dot 6 ($[.5, .6)$) and thus have a duration of 10% of the day (Dot 6-Dot 5). Every additional digit we add decreases the implied tolerance and the implied duration 10-fold.

If we really want to insist on punctuality, we could include up to 5 digits in a time. Specifying times with more than 5 digits is possible, and may be useful for scientific or technical purposes, but it is analogous to providing [extremely long GPS coordinates](https://xkcd.com/2170/); at some point the level of precision stops having relevance to daily life. If we want to strive for the highest level of precision possible, we can add the word "sharp" or the `#` symbol to the time. Saying "5 Sharp" or writing `5#` means as close as possible to noon. Times that include `#` cannot have an implied duration. We can only add `#` to a time, so there is no need say "Dot 5 Sharp" or write `.5#`.
