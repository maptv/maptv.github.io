This section of my site focuses on Dec, a [measurement system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_units_of_measurement#:~:text=a%20collection%20of%20units%20of%20measurement%20and%20rules%20relating%20them%20to%20each%20other) that [I](https://maptv.github.io) created to measure⏳time,📍position,🧭orientation,📐angles, and🔄cycles in [turns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_%28angle%29#:~:text=a%20unit%20of%20plane%20angle%20measurement%20equal%20to%202%CF%80%C2%A0radians%2C%20360%C2%A0degrees) ([$\tau$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_%28angle%29#:~:text=the%20Greek%20letter,to%20one%20turn)) instead of months, weeks, hours, minutes, seconds, and degrees. For time measurement, Dec uses days and years, which are turns of a [celestial body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object#:~:text=a%20single%2C%20tightly%20bound%2C%20contiguous%20entity) on [its axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#:~:text=the%20imaginary%20line%20that%20passes%20through%20both%20the%20north%20pole%20and%20south%20pole) and around [the point it orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter_%28astronomy%29#:~:text=the%20point%20about%20which%20the%20bodies%20orbit), respectively.
