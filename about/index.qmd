I am a data scientist and software engineer with a broad scientific background that ranges from biochemistry to epidemiology.

I use the JavaScript, Python, and R programming languages along with the UNIX shell to build digital deliverables such as cloud[]{.bi .bi-cloud}infrastructure, data[]{.bi .bi-bar-chart-line}dashboards, and machine[]{.bi .bi-robot}learning models.

In addition to programming languages, I also like natural languages! I speak English, Polish, Spanish, Russian, French, and Portuguese.

My favorite music genres are [Zouk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouk#:~:text=a%20musical%20movement%20pioneered%20by%20the%20French%20Antillean%20band%20Kassav%27%20in%20the%20early%201980s), [Konpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compas#:~:text=a%20modern%20m%C3%A9ringue%20dance%20music%20genre%20of%20Haiti), and [Kizomba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kizomba#:~:text=a%20social%20dance%20and%20music%20genre%20that%20originated%20in%20Angola%20during%20late%201970s%20to%20early%201980s), but I also enjoy many different kinds of African, Caribbean, and Latin music.
