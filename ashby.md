Hello John,

My name is Irina Lapteva and I work as the Director of the Arts at CCBC.

I am curious about whether my husband could use the Fitness Center at the CCBC Essex campus.

Is there a fee for family members? Am I entitled to guests passes?

Thank you in advance for answering my questions.

Best Regards,
Irina

Hi Carly,

I hope all's well with you and that you had a nice Labor Day weekend.

Congratulations on becoming the Director of the WLP!

I recently moved to Baltimore. Would you be willing to be a reference on my application to teach at a local community college?

Best Wishes,
Martin

I just realized that it's been about 10 years and that I should not assume that you remember meðŸ˜…
I taught Biology of Organisms and the Women and Leadership seminar for a semester in 2015 as I was finishing up my PhD at Georgetown University.


Hi Jithesh,

I hope all's well with you and that you had a nice Labor Day weekend.

I recently moved to Baltimore and I live walking distance to the Community College of Baltimore (CCBC) Essex campus. I would like to start teaching there.

It's been about a while since I taught at FAES, but I was hoping that you still remember me and might be willing to be a reference on my application to teach at CCBC.

Best Wishes,
Martin


Dear Dr. Ashby,

My name in Martin Laptev.

I recently moved across the street from the CCBC Essex campus with my wife, Irina Lapteva (cc'ed), who works as the Director of the Arts at CCBC.

I am interested in teaching Science at CCBC. I see that there is an Full-Time Faculty opening in Anatomy and Physiology and Adjunct Faculty positions in Biology and Chemistry. I am planning to apply as soon as I hear back from the people who I asked to be references on my applications.

My question is should whether I apply for the Full-Time Faculty position 




My name is Martin Laptev.

My wife Irina Lapteva, who works as the Director of the Arts at CCBC, recently spoke to you about math and science teaching opportunities at CCBC.

As I am sure Irina mentioned, I am interested in teaching science at CCBC.

Today, I applied for the Anatomy and Physiology 10-month Faculty position and the Adjunct Faculty positions in the screenshot below.

Are there any other steps I can take at this point to work towards teaching science at CCBC?

Best Wishes,
Martin Laptev
