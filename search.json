Announced on 2022+149 by Posit CEO JJ Allaire, Quarto is already taking the world🌐by storm⛈️!\nI strongly believe that everyone, regardless of their background and current technical skill level, can learn and benefit from Quarto. Getting started with Quarto is easy thanks to its excellent documentation and vibrant community of enthusiastic users and developers.\nRather than repeat the basic information already available elsewhere, I will share some advanced techniques along with the fundamental knowledge needed to understand how they work. The topics I cover are very technical, but my goal is to make the content on my blog as accessible as possible.\nThe first topic I will delve into is creating and publishing a website with Quarto. To follow the Quarto documentation on creating a website, you will need Visual Studio Code (VSCode), VSCodium, RStudio, or a terminal.",

    "text": "Publishing Quarto sites\n\nInstalling tools\nIf you use macOS, Linux, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can install all of the aforementioned tools with the Homebrew package manager. To install everything you will need to follow along with this blog post, you can first install Homebrew and then run brew bundle in a directory that contains the Brewfile shown in Example 1.\n\nExample 1  \n\n\nBrewfile\n\nbrew \"gh\"\nbrew \"git\"\nbrew \"glab\"\ncask \"github\"\ncask \"quarto\"\ncask \"rstudio\"\ncask \"vscodium\"\ncask \"visual-studio-code\"\nvscode \"quarto.quarto\"\nvscode \"REditorSupport.r\"\n\n\nUsing a package manager like Homebrew to install all the requirements with a single shell command like brew bundle is the fastest and easiest way to get ready to follow along with this blog post. If you are curious about how I set up my computer, you can take a look at my Brewfile and other configuration files in my setup repository (repo) on GitHub and GitLab.\nApart from RStudio, VSCode, and VSCodium, the Brewfile in Example 1 will install the Git version control system, the GitHub and GitLab command line interfaces (CLIs), and GitHub Desktop, a Git Graphical User Interface (GUI). For more information on Git, a tool used by 93% of software developers worldwide according to survey results published by StackOverflow on 2022+314, take a look at the “GitHub for supporting, reusing, contributing, and failing safely” post by Allison Horst and Julie Lowndes on the Openscapes blog.\nAs an alternative to installing tools on your computer, you can use the web interface provided by GitHub Codespaces. To set up a Codespace, you can remove the lines that start with cask from the Brewfile provided in Example 1 and add the file to a repo called dotfiles and along with a setup.sh file like the one shown in Example 2.\n\nExample 2  \n\n\nsetup.sh\n\necho | /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n(echo; echo 'eval \"$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"') &gt;&gt; /home/codespace/.profile\neval \"$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\nbrew bundle\n\n\n\n\nPublishing overview\nOnce you are done setting up your computer or Codespace, you create a Quarto website template and make your site publicly available on the internet using one of the many available publishing services. To explore and assess different publishing workflows and free website hosting options, I set up my personal website on four different web hosts: Quarto Pub, Netlify, GitHub Pages, and GitLab Pages.\nThere are so many different ways to publish a Quarto site that I decided to come up with a naming system for Quarto publishing methods. The naming system derives a code for each publishing method from the numbered lists in the Quarto publishing documentation. For example, I refer to the two methods to publish to Quarto Pub as Q1 and Q2:\nTable 1 uses this naming system in its Code column to identify the publishing methods I discuss in this blog post. Each publishing method targets a particular web Host, Renders content locally or on a remote server, and deploys sites using either the quarto publish or the git push shell Command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nHost\nRender\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nG1\nGitHub\nLocal\npush\n\n\nG2\nGitHub\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nG3\nGitHub\nRemote\npush\n\n\nN1\nNetlify\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nN2\nNetlify\nLocal\npush\n\n\nN3\nNetlify\nRemote\npush\n\n\nQ1\nQuarto\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nQ2\nQuarto\nRemote\npush\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Quarto website publishing methods\n\n\n\n\n\nGit workflow\nThe first publishing method I tried for my personal site was G1, which requires the use of Git to push all website content to a Git provider like GitHub or GitLab. After I set up GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages, I could update my website on both of these web hosts just by going through the standard Git workflow shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[working&lt;br/&gt;directory]-.git&lt;br/&gt;add.-&gt;B{{staging&lt;br/&gt;area}}-.git&lt;br/&gt;commit.-&gt;C([local&lt;br/&gt;repo])-.git&lt;br/&gt;push.-&gt;D(remote&lt;br/&gt;repo)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Git workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to make incremental changes to my website and frequently release new content, I combined all of the git shell commands in Figure 2 into a shell alias. You can add shell aliases to a shell configuration file like .bashrc or .zshrc on your computer to shorten commands or combine any sequence of commands into one step.\nThe aacmp alias in the .zshrc file in my setup repo allows me to enter a free-form commit message directly on the command line without quotes, e.g. qp edit first blog. If you decide to try my aacmp alias, please exercise extreme caution as any un-escaped or un-quoted metacharacters may yield surprising effects instead of being included verbatim in the commit message. For example, qp * will list the contents of the current directory in the commit message in place of the asterisk!\nAn alternative to a shell alias that combines git commands is a keyboard shortcut in Git-enabled GUI. Example 3 shows two files, tasks.json and update.sh, that we can use to set up VSCode, VSCodium, and GitHub Codespaces to go through the Git workflow whenever we press Ctrl+Shift+B on Linux/Windows or ⌘+Shift+B on Mac (mnemonic: B is for Build).\n\nExample 3  \n\nupdate.shtasks.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis mechanism is called Tasks and is used to automate software build tasks, which can include any steps required to build and publish a website. Importantly, the Tasks mechanism requires that the tasks.json file be added to the .vscode directory and that we enable execution of the update.sh script by running chmod +x update.sh in our project root.\nShell aliases and keyboard shortcuts can greatly facilitate the Git workflow which is essential not only for G1, but also G3, N3, and Q2. Unlike these other publishing methods, G1 leads to messy commits that contain changes to both source and output files.\n\n\nquarto publish\nTo have cleaner commits, I switched from G1 to G2 by adding quarto publish to my publishing workflow. With G2, I can track changes to my source files on my main branch and publish my output files to GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages from my gh-pages branch.\nQ1, N1, and G2 all use quarto publish to render website content locally and then deploy it in one fell swoop. If you do not plan to use the Git version control system or the advanced features offered by GitHub, GitLab, or Netlify, then I recommend deploying your site to Quarto Pub by running quarto publish quarto-pub (Q1 in Table 1).\nLike Q1, N1 is a deployment method that does not require Git and makes it possible to deploy our site with a single shell command: quarto publish netlify. N1 provides access to the advanced web hosting features offered by Netlify and can even render content as long as code execution is frozen.\nTo deploy my site to GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, and Netlify, I combined G2 and N2. When I run quarto publish gh-pages, Quarto renders my site into my output directory, copies the output directory contents to the gh-pages branch of my local repo, and then commits and pushes the changes to my remote repos on GitHub and GitLab, which triggers Netlify to build my site from the gh-pages branch.\nTo summarize the Quarto publishing methods I discussed so far, Q1 and N1 are easy to configure and use, N2 automatically builds sites from Git repos, G1 is not recommended because it pollutes commits with output file changes, and G2 is more difficult to set up and use but provides clean commits and a nice separation of source and output files.\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nAll of the publishing methods I have discussed so far require us to generate output files locally by rendering our source files. In contrast, Q2, G3, and N3 make it possible to skip local rendering in favor of relying on GitHub Actions to handle all of the necessary steps.\nG3 is noteworthy, because it offers the same convenience of G1 but without messy commits that mix changes to source and output files. An added bonus of G3 is that rendering with GitHub Actions provides a reproducible computational environment that is not dependent on what you have installed on your computer.\nInstead of using GitHub Actions, I could have used GitLab CI/CD to build my site. I decided not to go down this route because the Quarto dev team has many GitHub Actions workflows available but currently no official support for GitLab CI/CD.\nBefore trying to use GitHub Actions or any other continuous integration systems in your publishing workflow, I suggest getting used to working with quarto publish (Q1, G2, or N1). You can always set up other publishing methods later without sacrificing anything, because all of the publishing methods except G1 can be combined together.\nIn Section 4, I will walk through the setup of both G2 and G3 to provide the option of rendering locally by running quarto publish or rendering remotely with GitHub Actions by pushing to the main branch. Along the way, I will share many practical tips and general advice that you can apply to any project.",

    "section": "Publishing setup",
    "text": "Publishing setup\n\nRepo setup\nBefore you can use GitHub Actions to publish your site, you will need a GitHub, an SSH key, and a repo like maptv.github.io that has a default branch called main and another branch which must be called gh-pages. If you want to publish on GitLab Pages, you will also need a GitLab account and an analogous GitLab repo like maptv.gitlab.io.\nYou can create the repo and the gh-pages branch using the web interface of https://github.com or https://gitlab.com in your browser, but the best way to start a new project is using the CLI for GitHub or GitLab in your terminal. First, run gh auth login or glab auth login and follow the prompts to authenticate via your web browser or with an authentication token.\nThe GitHub CLI allows you to add an SSH key to your account during or after authentication. The GitLab CLI does not handle SSH keys during authentication, but has a similar command for adding an SSH key to your GitLab account.\nAfter authentication and SSH key setup, you can run the code in either of the code chunks in Example 4 to set up your local and remote repos and create a Quarto website project in the local repo. You can create shell alias that combine all of the repo creation steps like I did in my .zshrc.\n\nExample 4  \n\nGitHubGitLab\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir -p USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\ngh repo create USERNAME.github.io --add-readme --clone --public\ncd SITENAME\nquarto create project website USERNAME.github.io\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir -p USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\nglab repo create USERNAME.gitlab.io --readme --defaultBranch main --public\ncd SITENAME\ngit pull origin main\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main\nquarto create project website USERNAME.gitlab.io\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to maintain my site on both GitHub and GitLab Pages, I set up my local repo cloned to have two origin remote URLs using the code as shown in Example 5. Now, running quarto publish or git push in my local repo, updates my content on both GitHub and GitLab.\n\nExample 5  \ngit remote add lab git@gitlab.com:maptv/maptv.gitlab.io\ngit remote add hub git@github.com:maptv/maptv.github.io\ngit remote set-url --add origin $(git remote get-url lab)\n\nIf you want to have your website hosted on GitHub Pages, you will need to set gh-pages as your source branch in your repo settings. For GitLab Pages, you will need to add a .gitlab-ci.yml file to your repo and update your _quarto.yml file as shown in Example 6 to include .gitlab-ci.yml as a resource in your output directory.\n\nExample 6  \n\n.gitlab-ci.yml_quarto.yml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, GitLab Pages includes a random hash in site URLs. To shorten the URL of my GitLab Pages site to &lt;maptv.gitlab.io&gt;, I had to uncheck Use unique domain under Deploy &gt; Pages in the GitLab sidebar.\nAt this point, we have completed G2 setup and you should be able to run quarto publish gh-pages from your main branch to render your site and deploy it to GitHub and/or GitLab Pages. Deploying with quarto publish at least once is a prerequisite for setting up any of the publishing methods that rely on GitHub Actions, because quarto publish creates a _publish.yml file in the root of your project that is required for publishing via GitHub Actions.\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nIn addition to the steps described above, G3 setup requires that we create a .github/workflows directory and add a YAML file to that directory. Example 7 contains the gh-pages.yml file I use for my own site and the shell code that can used to obtain this file.\n\nExample 7  \n\ncurlgh-pages.yml\n\n\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\ncd .github/workflows\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptv/maptv.github.io/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gh-pages.yml file in Example 7 installs Quarto, the R and Python programming languages, and the packages in the renv.lock and requirements.txt files. If you do not need R and/or Python, you can remove any unnecessary portions of the file.\nTo modify the Python files that are installed by GitHub Actions, you can edit the requirements.txt file in your repo. To update your renv.lock file so that it includes all of the R packages your site requires, run renv::snapshot() in an R session or Rscript -e renv::snapshot() in a shell.\nAfter pushing the gh-pages.yml file, you can visit the Actions tab in your remote repo on GitHub to check the progress of the deployment of your site. If your site did not build successfully, you can go through the logs to try to diagnose the problem.\nI added a “Push to GitLab” step to my gh-pages.yml to make GitHub Actions push my remote gh-pages to GitLab so that my site is kept in sync on both GitHub and GitLab Pages. This required manually creating a token on GitLab and adding it to GitHub, which I accomplished using the GitHub CLI as shown in Example 8.\n\nExample 8  \ngh secret set GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN\n\nAfter the setup described above, I now have two options for publishing my Quarto site: quarto publish and 2) git push. In addition to GitHub and GitLab Pages, both of these options automatically update my site on Netlify via N2.\nTo also automatically update my site on Quarto Pub, I created a separate GitHub Actions workflow by adding another YAML file to the .github/workflows directory in my repo. Example 9 shows my quarto-pub.yml file and the shell code that can be used to obtain it.\n\nExample 9  \n\ncurlquarto-pub.yml\n\n\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\ncd .github/workflows\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptv/maptv.github.io/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy quarto-pub.yml file is based on Q2, but it runs upon completion of the pages-build-deployment workflow instead of a push to main. I changed the workflow trigger so that it runs after my GitHub Pages site is built, regardless of whether I triggered the build by running quarto publish gh-pages or pushing to main.\nFigure 3 summarizes all of the steps that occur during my Quarto publishing workflow. This workflow allows me to publish my site on four web hosts every time I run quarto publish gh-pages (G2) or git push (G3)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G2.-&gt;B[local&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G2.-&gt;C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    B[local&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G2.-&gt;D[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;F[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G3.-&gt;D[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;G[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;main]\n    C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.N2.-&gt;E[Netlify]\n    C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.Q2.-&gt;H[Quarto&lt;br/&gt;Pub]\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Quarto publishing workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far I have only noticed one difference between the four web hosts I use for my site: GitHub Pages is the only web host that properly differentiates between internal and external links. All of the other web hosts include the external link icon on all links regardless of whether they target my site or an external site.\nI tried unsuccessfully to solve this issue by setting the link-external-filter property to a regular expression. If you notice a problem with the link-external-icon feature on other web hosts, I suggest switching to GitHub Pages.",

    "section": "Customizing Quarto sites",
    "text": "Customizing Quarto sites\n\nSite navigation\nOnce your site is built and published, you can make it easier to navigate with a customized navigation bar (navbar) and sidebar, as described in the Quarto documentation. Check out the _quarto.yml files for my site and the Quarto documentation site to see how the navigation components are set up.\nIn my navbar, I added toggle buttons for reader mode and dark mode. The names of the other icons on right side of the navbar are included in the sidebar.\n\n\nHTML blocks\nMy navbar also provides the current date and time in Dec ordinal (deco) format, which counts the years since 1 BC and the days since March 1. Dec is a calendar and time system that I created and use throughout my blog.\nTo add a custom timestamp to the navbar, I put a &lt;script&gt; element that runs time.js in an HTML block in every Quarto markdown (.qmd) file, as shown in Example 10. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel wrote about HTML blocks as part of her A Quarto tip a day project.\n\nExample 10  \n\n*.qmdtime.js\n\n\n```{=html}\n&lt;script src=\"time.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML blocks are useful for running JavaScript code in the context of a single page on your site without affecting the others. I also use HTML blocks to add a &lt;style&gt; element to my .qmd files as a last ditch effort to fine tune the style of my site.\nBefore I resort to the &lt;style&gt; element approach, I try writing CSS in my style.css, light.css, and dark.css files. So far, this approach has been sufficient to make any styling changes I want, but if it every fails, I can use JavaScript to override the default styling provided by Quarto by modifying style attributes, which have the highest specificity in CSS.\n\n\nPost-render script\nI wanted to my blog’s listing page to show dates in the same format as the navbar timestamp. To accomplish this, I used a post-render script written in the Python programming language.\nPre- and post-render scripts are set as project options in the _quarto.yml file in the root of your Quarto project. Example 11 shows the date.py post-render script and how this script is referenced in _quarto.yml.\n\nExample 11  \n\n_quarto.ymldate.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally, formatting dates in Quarto is as easy as setting the date-format YAML property. In my case it was more difficult, because I wanted dates based on Dec, the calendar and time system I created, instead of the ubiquitous Gregorian calendar.\nTo facilitate the calculations in date.py, I set date-format to x in my _metadata.yml file so all of the dates would be in millisecond UNIX time and I would not have to deal with Gregorian calendar date formats or time zones. After all of the dates are generated, my date.py script traverses the HTML in the output directory using Beautiful Soup and converts millisecond UNIX time dates into Dec dates (year+day).\n\n\nPandoc filter\nIn addition to customizing dates on the listing page of my blog, I wanted to customize the date format in every blog post. To complete this task, I used a Lua script as a Pandoc filter.\nPandoc is a program that converts documents into practically any format. The “pan” in Pandoc comes from the Ancient Greek word for all. Pandoc strives to convert all document formats, just like Pangea contained all the land and a panacea solves all problems.\nQuarto uses Pandoc to convert markdown files into target format(s) like html or pdf. If the source files contain executable code, Quarto executes the code via one of two computational engines: Jupyter or Knitr. Figure 4 shows the Quarto workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[qmd&lt;br/&gt;ipynb]-.Knitr&lt;br/&gt;Jupyter.-&gt;B((md))-.Pandoc with&lt;br/&gt;Lua filters.-&gt;C(html&lt;br/&gt;pdf&lt;br/&gt;docx&lt;br/&gt;etc.)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Quarto rendering workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s Quarto tip series includes a similar Quarto workflow mermaid diagram and her “Hello, Quarto!” rstudio::conf(2022) keynote with Julia Stewart Lowndes contains truly beautiful Quarto workflow images by Allison Horst: 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nQuarto controls Pandoc, Jupyter, and Knitr in two ways: 1) with arguments passed to the Quarto CLI commands and 2) with YAML key-value pairs in .qmd, .ipynb, or .yml files.\nExample 12 shows how I set up every qmd file to generate the current date in millisecond UNIX time and designated date.lua as a Pandoc filter. Unlike post-render scripts, Pandoc filters are executed during the creation of the output files.\n\nExample 12  \n\n*.qmddate.lua\n\n\ndate: now\ndate-format: x\nfilters: date.lua\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three of the customizations I described above convert millisecond UNIX time into a custom date format, but you can adapt these approaches to make all sorts of edits to your Quarto site. HTML blocks can run JavaScript which excels at making content dynamic and interactive, pre- and post-render scripts can be in any programming language, while Pandoc filters are written in Lua and modify output during rendering.\nComing up next on my blog is a post that Observable graphics. Get ready for an animated and interactive data visualization extravaganza!",

    "text": "Publishing Quarto sites\n\nInstalling tools\nIf you use macOS, Linux, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can install all of the aforementioned tools with the Homebrew package manager. To install everything you will need to follow along with this blog post, you can first install Homebrew and then run brew bundle in a directory that contains the Brewfile shown in Example 1.\n\nExample 1  \n\n\nBrewfile\n\nbrew \"gh\"\nbrew \"git\"\nbrew \"glab\"\ncask \"github\"\ncask \"quarto\"\ncask \"rstudio\"\ncask \"vscodium\"\ncask \"visual-studio-code\"\nvscode \"quarto.quarto\"\nvscode \"REditorSupport.r\"\n\n\nUsing a package manager like Homebrew to install all the requirements with a single shell command like brew bundle is the fastest and easiest way to get ready to follow along with this blog post. If you are curious about how I set up my computer, you can take a look at my Brewfile and other configuration files in my setup repository (repo) on GitHub and GitLab.\nApart from RStudio, VSCode, and VSCodium, the Brewfile in Example 1 will install the Git version control system, the GitHub and GitLab command line interfaces (CLIs), and GitHub Desktop, a Git Graphical User Interface (GUI). For more information on Git, a tool used by 93% of software developers worldwide according to survey results published by StackOverflow on 2022+314, take a look at the “GitHub for supporting, reusing, contributing, and failing safely” post by Allison Horst and Julie Lowndes on the Openscapes blog.\nAs an alternative to installing tools on your computer, you can use the web interface provided by GitHub Codespaces. To set up a Codespace, you can remove the lines that start with cask from the Brewfile provided in Example 1 and add the file to a repo called dotfiles and along with a setup.sh file like the one shown in Example 2.\n\nExample 2  \n\n\nsetup.sh\n\necho | /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n(echo; echo 'eval \"$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"') &gt;&gt; /home/codespace/.profile\neval \"$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\nbrew bundle\n\n\n\n\nPublishing overview\nOnce you are done setting up your computer or Codespace, you create a Quarto website template and make your site publicly available on the internet using one of the many available publishing services. To explore and assess different publishing workflows and free website hosting options, I set up my personal website on four different web hosts: Quarto Pub, Netlify, GitHub Pages, and GitLab Pages.\nThere are so many different ways to publish a Quarto site that I decided to come up with a naming system for Quarto publishing methods. The naming system derives a code for each publishing method from the numbered lists in the Quarto publishing documentation. For example, I refer to the two methods to publish to Quarto Pub as Q1 and Q2:\nTable 1 uses this naming system in its Code column to identify the publishing methods I discuss in this blog post. Each publishing method targets a particular web Host, Renders content locally or on a remote server, and deploys sites using either the quarto publish or the git push shell Command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nHost\nRender\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nG1\nGitHub\nLocal\npush\n\n\nG2\nGitHub\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nG3\nGitHub\nRemote\npush\n\n\nN1\nNetlify\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nN2\nNetlify\nLocal\npush\n\n\nN3\nNetlify\nRemote\npush\n\n\nQ1\nQuarto\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nQ2\nQuarto\nRemote\npush\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Quarto website publishing methods\n\n\n\n\n\nGit workflow\nThe first publishing method I tried for my personal site was G1, which requires the use of Git to push all website content to a Git provider like GitHub or GitLab. After I set up GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages, I could update my website on both of these web hosts just by going through the standard Git workflow shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[working&lt;br/&gt;directory]-.git&lt;br/&gt;add.-&gt;B{{staging&lt;br/&gt;area}}-.git&lt;br/&gt;commit.-&gt;C([local&lt;br/&gt;repo])-.git&lt;br/&gt;push.-&gt;D(remote&lt;br/&gt;repo)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Git workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to make incremental changes to my website and frequently release new content, I combined all of the git shell commands in Figure 2 into a shell alias. You can add shell aliases to a shell configuration file like .bashrc or .zshrc on your computer to shorten commands or combine any sequence of commands into one step.\nThe aacmp alias in the .zshrc file in my setup repo allows me to enter a free-form commit message directly on the command line without quotes, e.g. qp edit first blog. If you decide to try my aacmp alias, please exercise extreme caution as any un-escaped or un-quoted metacharacters may yield surprising effects instead of being included verbatim in the commit message. For example, qp * will list the contents of the current directory in the commit message in place of the asterisk!\nAn alternative to a shell alias that combines git commands is a keyboard shortcut in Git-enabled GUI. Example 3 shows two files, tasks.json and update.sh, that we can use to set up VSCode, VSCodium, and GitHub Codespaces to go through the Git workflow whenever we press Ctrl+Shift+B on Linux/Windows or ⌘+Shift+B on Mac (mnemonic: B is for Build).\n\nExample 3  \n\nupdate.shtasks.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis mechanism is called Tasks and is used to automate software build tasks, which can include any steps required to build and publish a website. Importantly, the Tasks mechanism requires that the tasks.json file be added to the .vscode directory and that we enable execution of the update.sh script by running chmod +x update.sh in our project root.\nShell aliases and keyboard shortcuts can greatly facilitate the Git workflow which is essential not only for G1, but also G3, N3, and Q2. Unlike these other publishing methods, G1 leads to messy commits that contain changes to both source and output files.\n\n\nquarto publish\nTo have cleaner commits, I switched from G1 to G2 by adding quarto publish to my publishing workflow. With G2, I can track changes to my source files on my main branch and publish my output files to GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages from my gh-pages branch.\nQ1, N1, and G2 all use quarto publish to render website content locally and then deploy it in one fell swoop. If you do not plan to use the Git version control system or the advanced features offered by GitHub, GitLab, or Netlify, then I recommend deploying your site to Quarto Pub by running quarto publish quarto-pub (Q1 in Table 1).\nLike Q1, N1 is a deployment method that does not require Git and makes it possible to deploy our site with a single shell command: quarto publish netlify. N1 provides access to the advanced web hosting features offered by Netlify and can even render content as long as code execution is frozen.\nTo deploy my site to GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, and Netlify, I combined G2 and N2. When I run quarto publish gh-pages, Quarto renders my site into my output directory, copies the output directory contents to the gh-pages branch of my local repo, and then commits and pushes the changes to my remote repos on GitHub and GitLab, which triggers Netlify to build my site from the gh-pages branch.\nTo summarize the Quarto publishing methods I discussed so far, Q1 and N1 are easy to configure and use, N2 automatically builds sites from Git repos, G1 is not recommended because it pollutes commits with output file changes, and G2 is more difficult to set up and use but provides clean commits and a nice separation of source and output files.\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nAll of the publishing methods I have discussed so far require us to generate output files locally by rendering our source files. In contrast, Q2, G3, and N3 make it possible to skip local rendering in favor of relying on GitHub Actions to handle all of the necessary steps.\nG3 is noteworthy, because it offers the same convenience of G1 but without messy commits that mix changes to source and output files. An added bonus of G3 is that rendering with GitHub Actions provides a reproducible computational environment that is not dependent on what you have installed on your computer.\nInstead of using GitHub Actions, I could have used GitLab CI/CD to build my site. I decided not to go down this route because the Quarto dev team has many GitHub Actions workflows available but currently no official support for GitLab CI/CD.\nBefore trying to use GitHub Actions or any other continuous integration systems in your publishing workflow, I suggest getting used to working with quarto publish (Q1, G2, or N1). You can always set up other publishing methods later without sacrificing anything, because all of the publishing methods except G1 can be combined together.\nIn Section 4, I will walk through the setup of both G2 and G3 to provide the option of rendering locally by running quarto publish or rendering remotely with GitHub Actions by pushing to the main branch. Along the way, I will share many practical tips and general advice that you can apply to any project.",

    "section": "Publishing setup",
    "text": "Publishing setup\n\nRepo setup\nBefore you can use GitHub Actions to publish your site, you will need a GitHub, an SSH key, and a repo like maptv.github.io that has a default branch called main and another branch which must be called gh-pages. If you want to publish on GitLab Pages, you will also need a GitLab account and an analogous GitLab repo like maptv.gitlab.io.\nYou can create the repo and the gh-pages branch using the web interface of https://github.com or https://gitlab.com in your browser, but the best way to start a new project is using the CLI for GitHub or GitLab in your terminal. First, run gh auth login or glab auth login and follow the prompts to authenticate via your web browser or with an authentication token.\nThe GitHub CLI allows you to add an SSH key to your account during or after authentication. The GitLab CLI does not handle SSH keys during authentication, but has a similar command for adding an SSH key to your GitLab account.\nAfter authentication and SSH key setup, you can run the code in either of the code chunks in Example 4 to set up your local and remote repos and create a Quarto website project in the local repo. You can create shell alias that combine all of the repo creation steps like I did in my .zshrc.\n\nExample 4  \n\nGitHubGitLab\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir -p USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\ngh repo create USERNAME.github.io --add-readme --clone --public\ncd SITENAME\nquarto create project website USERNAME.github.io\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir -p USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\nglab repo create USERNAME.gitlab.io --readme --defaultBranch main --public\ncd SITENAME\ngit pull origin main\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main\nquarto create project website USERNAME.gitlab.io\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to maintain my site on both GitHub and GitLab Pages, I set up my local repo cloned to have two origin remote URLs using the code as shown in Example 5. Now, running quarto publish or git push in my local repo, updates my content on both GitHub and GitLab.\n\nExample 5  \ngit remote add lab git@gitlab.com:maptv/maptv.gitlab.io\ngit remote add hub git@github.com:maptv/maptv.github.io\ngit remote set-url --add origin $(git remote get-url lab)\n\nIf you want to have your website hosted on GitHub Pages, you will need to set gh-pages as your source branch in your repo settings. For GitLab Pages, you will need to add a .gitlab-ci.yml file to your repo and update your _quarto.yml file as shown in Example 6 to include .gitlab-ci.yml as a resource in your output directory.\n\nExample 6  \n\n.gitlab-ci.yml_quarto.yml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, GitLab Pages includes a random hash in site URLs. To shorten the URL of my GitLab Pages site to &lt;maptv.gitlab.io&gt;, I had to uncheck Use unique domain under Deploy &gt; Pages in the GitLab sidebar.\nAt this point, we have completed G2 setup and you should be able to run quarto publish gh-pages from your main branch to render your site and deploy it to GitHub and/or GitLab Pages. Deploying with quarto publish at least once is a prerequisite for setting up any of the publishing methods that rely on GitHub Actions, because quarto publish creates a _publish.yml file in the root of your project that is required for publishing via GitHub Actions.\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nIn addition to the steps described above, G3 setup requires that we create a .github/workflows directory and add a YAML file to that directory. Example 7 contains the gh-pages.yml file I use for my own site and the shell code that can used to obtain this file.\n\nExample 7  \n\ncurlgh-pages.yml\n\n\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\ncd .github/workflows\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptv/maptv.github.io/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gh-pages.yml file in Example 7 installs Quarto, the R and Python programming languages, and the packages in the renv.lock and requirements.txt files. If you do not need R and/or Python, you can remove any unnecessary portions of the file.\nTo modify the Python files that are installed by GitHub Actions, you can edit the requirements.txt file in your repo. To update your renv.lock file so that it includes all of the R packages your site requires, run renv::snapshot() in an R session or Rscript -e renv::snapshot() in a shell.\nAfter pushing the gh-pages.yml file, you can visit the Actions tab in your remote repo on GitHub to check the progress of the deployment of your site. If your site did not build successfully, you can go through the logs to try to diagnose the problem.\nI added a “Push to GitLab” step to my gh-pages.yml to make GitHub Actions push my remote gh-pages to GitLab so that my site is kept in sync on both GitHub and GitLab Pages. This required manually creating a token on GitLab and adding it to GitHub, which I accomplished using the GitHub CLI as shown in Example 8.\n\nExample 8  \ngh secret set GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN\n\nAfter the setup described above, I now have two options for publishing my Quarto site: quarto publish and 2) git push. In addition to GitHub and GitLab Pages, both of these options automatically update my site on Netlify via N2.\nTo also automatically update my site on Quarto Pub, I created a separate GitHub Actions workflow by adding another YAML file to the .github/workflows directory in my repo. Example 9 shows my quarto-pub.yml file and the shell code that can be used to obtain it.\n\nExample 9  \n\ncurlquarto-pub.yml\n\n\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\ncd .github/workflows\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptv/maptv.github.io/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy quarto-pub.yml file is based on Q2, but it runs upon completion of the pages-build-deployment workflow instead of a push to main. I changed the workflow trigger so that it runs after my GitHub Pages site is built, regardless of whether I triggered the build by running quarto publish gh-pages or pushing to main.\nFigure 3 summarizes all of the steps that occur during my Quarto publishing workflow. This workflow allows me to publish my site on four web hosts every time I run quarto publish gh-pages (G2) or git push (G3)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G2.-&gt;B[local&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G2.-&gt;C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    B[local&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G2.-&gt;D[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;F[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G3.-&gt;D[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;G[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;main]\n    C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.N2.-&gt;E[Netlify]\n    C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.Q2.-&gt;H[Quarto&lt;br/&gt;Pub]\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Quarto publishing workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far I have only noticed one difference between the four web hosts I use for my site: GitHub Pages is the only web host that properly differentiates between internal and external links. All of the other web hosts include the external link icon on all links regardless of whether they target my site or an external site.\nI tried unsuccessfully to solve this issue by setting the link-external-filter property to a regular expression. If you notice a problem with the link-external-icon feature on other web hosts, I suggest switching to GitHub Pages.",

    "section": "Customizing Quarto sites",
    "text": "Customizing Quarto sites\n\nSite navigation\nOnce your site is built and published, you can make it easier to navigate with a customized navigation bar (navbar) and sidebar, as described in the Quarto documentation. Check out the _quarto.yml files for my site and the Quarto documentation site to see how the navigation components are set up.\nIn my navbar, I added toggle buttons for reader mode and dark mode. The names of the other icons on right side of the navbar are included in the sidebar.\n\n\nHTML blocks\nMy navbar also provides the current date and time in Dec ordinal (deco) format, which counts the years since 1 BC and the days since March 1. Dec is a calendar and time system that I created and use throughout my blog.\nTo add a custom timestamp to the navbar, I put a &lt;script&gt; element that runs time.js in an HTML block in every Quarto markdown (.qmd) file, as shown in Example 10. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel wrote about HTML blocks as part of her A Quarto tip a day project.\n\nExample 10  \n\n*.qmdtime.js\n\n\n```{=html}\n&lt;script src=\"time.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML blocks are useful for running JavaScript code in the context of a single page on your site without affecting the others. I also use HTML blocks to add a &lt;style&gt; element to my .qmd files as a last ditch effort to fine tune the style of my site.\nBefore I resort to the &lt;style&gt; element approach, I try writing CSS in my style.css, light.css, and dark.css files. So far, this approach has been sufficient to make any styling changes I want, but if it every fails, I can use JavaScript to override the default styling provided by Quarto by modifying style attributes, which have the highest specificity in CSS.\n\n\nPost-render script\nI wanted to my blog’s listing page to show dates in the same format as the navbar timestamp. To accomplish this, I used a post-render script written in the Python programming language.\nPre- and post-render scripts are set as project options in the _quarto.yml file in the root of your Quarto project. Example 11 shows the date.py post-render script and how this script is referenced in _quarto.yml.\n\nExample 11  \n\n_quarto.ymldate.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally, formatting dates in Quarto is as easy as setting the date-format YAML property. In my case it was more difficult, because I wanted dates based on Dec, the calendar and time system I created, instead of the ubiquitous Gregorian calendar.\nTo facilitate the calculations in date.py, I set date-format to x in my _metadata.yml file so all of the dates would be in millisecond UNIX time and I would not have to deal with Gregorian calendar date formats or time zones. After all of the dates are generated, my date.py script traverses the HTML in the output directory using Beautiful Soup and converts millisecond UNIX time dates into Dec dates (year+day).\n\n\nPandoc filter\nIn addition to customizing dates on the listing page of my blog, I wanted to customize the date format in every blog post. To complete this task, I used a Lua script as a Pandoc filter.\nPandoc is a program that converts documents into practically any format. The “pan” in Pandoc comes from the Ancient Greek word for all. Pandoc strives to convert all document formats, just like Pangea contained all the land and a panacea solves all problems.\nQuarto uses Pandoc to convert markdown files into target format(s) like html or pdf. If the source files contain executable code, Quarto executes the code via one of two computational engines: Jupyter or Knitr. Figure 4 shows the Quarto workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[qmd&lt;br/&gt;ipynb]-.Knitr&lt;br/&gt;Jupyter.-&gt;B((md))-.Pandoc with&lt;br/&gt;Lua filters.-&gt;C(html&lt;br/&gt;pdf&lt;br/&gt;docx&lt;br/&gt;etc.)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Quarto rendering workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s Quarto tip series includes a similar Quarto workflow mermaid diagram and her “Hello, Quarto!” rstudio::conf(2022) keynote with Julia Stewart Lowndes contains truly beautiful Quarto workflow images by Allison Horst: 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nQuarto controls Pandoc, Jupyter, and Knitr in two ways: 1) with arguments passed to the Quarto CLI commands and 2) with YAML key-value pairs in .qmd, .ipynb, or .yml files.\nExample 12 shows how I set up every qmd file to generate the current date in millisecond UNIX time and designated date.lua as a Pandoc filter. Unlike post-render scripts, Pandoc filters are executed during the creation of the output files.\n\nExample 12  \n\n*.qmddate.lua\n\n\ndate: now\ndate-format: x\nfilters: date.lua\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three of the customizations I described above convert millisecond UNIX time into a custom date format, but you can adapt these approaches to make all sorts of edits to your Quarto site. HTML blocks can run JavaScript which excels at making content dynamic and interactive, pre- and post-render scripts can be in any programming language, while Pandoc filters are written in Lua and modify output during rendering.\nComing up next on my blog is a post that Observable graphics. Get ready for an animated and interactive data visualization extravaganza!",

    "text": "Publishing Quarto sites\n\nInstalling tools\nIf you use macOS, Linux, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can install all of the aforementioned tools with the Homebrew package manager. To install everything you will need to follow along with this blog post, you can first install Homebrew and then run brew bundle in a directory that contains the Brewfile shown in Example 1.\n\nExample 1  \n\n\nBrewfile\n\nbrew \"gh\"\nbrew \"git\"\nbrew \"glab\"\ncask \"github\"\ncask \"quarto\"\ncask \"rstudio\"\ncask \"vscodium\"\ncask \"visual-studio-code\"\nvscode \"quarto.quarto\"\nvscode \"REditorSupport.r\"\n\n\nUsing a package manager like Homebrew to install all the requirements with a single shell command like brew bundle is the fastest and easiest way to get ready to follow along with this blog post. If you are curious about how I set up my computer, you can take a look at my Brewfile and other configuration files in my setup repository (repo) on GitHub and GitLab.\nApart from RStudio, VSCode, and VSCodium, the Brewfile in Example 1 will install the Git version control system, the GitHub and GitLab command line interfaces (CLIs), and GitHub Desktop, a Git Graphical User Interface (GUI). For more information on Git, a tool used by 93% of software developers worldwide according to survey results published by StackOverflow on 2022+314, take a look at the “GitHub for supporting, reusing, contributing, and failing safely” post by Allison Horst and Julie Lowndes on the Openscapes blog.\nAs an alternative to installing tools on your computer, you can use the web interface provided by GitHub Codespaces. To set up a Codespace, you can remove the lines that start with cask from the Brewfile provided in Example 1 and add the file to a repo called dotfiles and along with a setup.sh file like the one shown in Example 2.\n\nExample 2  \n\n\nsetup.sh\n\necho | /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n(echo; echo 'eval \"$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"') &gt;&gt; /home/codespace/.profile\neval \"$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\nbrew bundle\n\n\n\n\nPublishing overview\nOnce you are done setting up your computer or Codespace, you create a Quarto website template and make your site publicly available on the internet using one of the many available publishing services. To explore and assess different publishing workflows and free website hosting options, I set up my personal website on four different web hosts: Quarto Pub, Netlify, GitHub Pages, and GitLab Pages.\nThere are so many different ways to publish a Quarto site that I decided to come up with a naming system for Quarto publishing methods. The naming system derives a code for each publishing method from the numbered lists in the Quarto publishing documentation. For example, I refer to the two methods to publish to Quarto Pub as Q1 and Q2:\nTable 1 uses this naming system in its Code column to identify the publishing methods I discuss in this blog post. Each publishing method targets a particular web Host, Renders content locally or on a remote server, and deploys sites using either the quarto publish or the git push shell Command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nHost\nRender\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nG1\nGitHub\nLocal\npush\n\n\nG2\nGitHub\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nG3\nGitHub\nRemote\npush\n\n\nN1\nNetlify\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nN2\nNetlify\nLocal\npush\n\n\nN3\nNetlify\nRemote\npush\n\n\nQ1\nQuarto\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nQ2\nQuarto\nRemote\npush\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Quarto website publishing methods\n\n\n\n\n\nGit workflow\nThe first publishing method I tried for my personal site was G1, which requires the use of Git to push all website content to a Git provider like GitHub or GitLab. After I set up GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages, I could update my website on both of these web hosts just by going through the standard Git workflow shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[working&lt;br/&gt;directory]-.git&lt;br/&gt;add.-&gt;B{{staging&lt;br/&gt;area}}-.git&lt;br/&gt;commit.-&gt;C([local&lt;br/&gt;repo])-.git&lt;br/&gt;push.-&gt;D(remote&lt;br/&gt;repo)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Git workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to make incremental changes to my website and frequently release new content, I combined all of the git shell commands in Figure 2 into a shell alias. You can add shell aliases to a shell configuration file like .bashrc or .zshrc on your computer to shorten commands or combine any sequence of commands into one step.\nThe aacmp alias in the .zshrc file in my setup repo allows me to enter a free-form commit message directly on the command line without quotes, e.g. qp edit first blog. If you decide to try my aacmp alias, please exercise extreme caution as any un-escaped or un-quoted metacharacters may yield surprising effects instead of being included verbatim in the commit message. For example, qp * will list the contents of the current directory in the commit message in place of the asterisk!\nAn alternative to a shell alias that combines git commands is a keyboard shortcut in Git-enabled GUI. Example 3 shows two files, tasks.json and update.sh, that we can use to set up VSCode, VSCodium, and GitHub Codespaces to go through the Git workflow whenever we press Ctrl+Shift+B on Linux/Windows or ⌘+Shift+B on Mac (mnemonic: B is for Build).\n\nExample 3  \n\nupdate.shtasks.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis mechanism is called Tasks and is used to automate software build tasks, which can include any steps required to build and publish a website. Importantly, the Tasks mechanism requires that the tasks.json file be added to the .vscode directory and that we enable execution of the update.sh script by running chmod +x update.sh in our project root.\nShell aliases and keyboard shortcuts can greatly facilitate the Git workflow which is essential not only for G1, but also G3, N3, and Q2. Unlike these other publishing methods, G1 leads to messy commits that contain changes to both source and output files.\n\n\nquarto publish\nTo have cleaner commits, I switched from G1 to G2 by adding quarto publish to my publishing workflow. With G2, I can track changes to my source files on my main branch and publish my output files to GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages from my gh-pages branch.\nQ1, N1, and G2 all use quarto publish to render website content locally and then deploy it in one fell swoop. If you do not plan to use the Git version control system or the advanced features offered by GitHub, GitLab, or Netlify, then I recommend deploying your site to Quarto Pub by running quarto publish quarto-pub (Q1 in Table 1).\nLike Q1, N1 is a deployment method that does not require Git and makes it possible to deploy our site with a single shell command: quarto publish netlify. N1 provides access to the advanced web hosting features offered by Netlify and can even render content as long as code execution is frozen.\nTo deploy my site to GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, and Netlify, I combined G2 and N2. When I run quarto publish gh-pages, Quarto renders my site into my output directory, copies the output directory contents to the gh-pages branch of my local repo, and then commits and pushes the changes to my remote repos on GitHub and GitLab, which triggers Netlify to build my site from the gh-pages branch.\nTo summarize the Quarto publishing methods I discussed so far, Q1 and N1 are easy to configure and use, N2 automatically builds sites from Git repos, G1 is not recommended because it pollutes commits with output file changes, and G2 is more difficult to set up and use but provides clean commits and a nice separation of source and output files.\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nAll of the publishing methods I have discussed so far require us to generate output files locally by rendering our source files. In contrast, Q2, G3, and N3 make it possible to skip local rendering in favor of relying on GitHub Actions to handle all of the necessary steps.\nG3 is noteworthy, because it offers the same convenience of G1 but without messy commits that mix changes to source and output files. An added bonus of G3 is that rendering with GitHub Actions provides a reproducible computational environment that is not dependent on what you have installed on your computer.\nInstead of using GitHub Actions, I could have used GitLab CI/CD to build my site. I decided not to go down this route because the Quarto dev team has many GitHub Actions workflows available but currently no official support for GitLab CI/CD.\nBefore trying to use GitHub Actions or any other continuous integration systems in your publishing workflow, I suggest getting used to working with quarto publish (Q1, G2, or N1). You can always set up other publishing methods later without sacrificing anything, because all of the publishing methods except G1 can be combined together.\nIn Section 4, I will walk through the setup of both G2 and G3 to provide the option of rendering locally by running quarto publish or rendering remotely with GitHub Actions by pushing to the main branch. Along the way, I will share many practical tips and general advice that you can apply to any project.",

    "text": "Publishing setup\n\nRepo setup\nBefore you can use GitHub Actions to publish your site, you will need a GitHub, an SSH key, and a repo like maptv.github.io that has a default branch called main and another branch which must be called gh-pages. If you want to publish on GitLab Pages, you will also need a GitLab account and an analogous GitLab repo like maptv.gitlab.io.\nYou can create the repo and the gh-pages branch using the web interface of https://github.com or https://gitlab.com in your browser, but the best way to start a new project is using the CLI for GitHub or GitLab in your terminal. First, run gh auth login or glab auth login and follow the prompts to authenticate via your web browser or with an authentication token.\nThe GitHub CLI allows you to add an SSH key to your account during or after authentication. The GitLab CLI does not handle SSH keys during authentication, but has a similar command for adding an SSH key to your GitLab account.\nAfter authentication and SSH key setup, you can run the code in either of the code chunks in Example 4 to set up your local and remote repos and create a Quarto website project in the local repo. You can create shell alias that combine all of the repo creation steps like I did in my .zshrc.\n\nExample 4  \n\nGitHubGitLab\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir -p USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\ngh repo create USERNAME.github.io --add-readme --clone --public\ncd SITENAME\nquarto create project website USERNAME.github.io\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir -p USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\nglab repo create USERNAME.gitlab.io --readme --defaultBranch main --public\ncd SITENAME\ngit pull origin main\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main\nquarto create project website USERNAME.gitlab.io\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to maintain my site on both GitHub and GitLab Pages, I set up my local repo cloned to have two origin remote URLs using the code as shown in Example 5. Now, running quarto publish or git push in my local repo, updates my content on both GitHub and GitLab.\n\nExample 5  \ngit remote add lab git@gitlab.com:maptv/maptv.gitlab.io\ngit remote add hub git@github.com:maptv/maptv.github.io\ngit remote set-url --add origin $(git remote get-url lab)\n\nIf you want to have your website hosted on GitHub Pages, you will need to set gh-pages as your source branch in your repo settings. For GitLab Pages, you will need to add a .gitlab-ci.yml file to your repo and update your _quarto.yml file as shown in Example 6 to include .gitlab-ci.yml as a resource in your output directory.\n\nExample 6  \n\n.gitlab-ci.yml_quarto.yml\n\n\n# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/introduction.html#customize-the-default-folder\npages:\n  script: echo \"The site will be deployed to $CI_PAGES_URL\"\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - \".\"\n  publish: \".\"\n  only:\n    - gh-pages\n\n\nauthor:\n  - name: Martin Laptev\n    url: https://maptv.github.io\n\n\n\n\nBy default, GitLab Pages includes a random hash in site URLs. To shorten the URL of my GitLab Pages site to &lt;maptv.gitlab.io&gt;, I had to uncheck Use unique domain under Deploy &gt; Pages in the GitLab sidebar.\nAt this point, we have completed G2 setup and you should be able to run quarto publish gh-pages from your main branch to render your site and deploy it to GitHub and/or GitLab Pages. Deploying with quarto publish at least once is a prerequisite for setting up any of the publishing methods that rely on GitHub Actions, because quarto publish creates a _publish.yml file in the root of your project that is required for publishing via GitHub Actions.\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nIn addition to the steps described above, G3 setup requires that we create a .github/workflows directory and add a YAML file to that directory. Example 7 contains the gh-pages.yml file I use for my own site and the shell code that can used to obtain this file.\n\nExample 7  \n\ncurlgh-pages.yml\n\n\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\ncd .github/workflows\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptv/maptv.github.io/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml\n\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n\nname: Quarto Publish\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n        with:\n          version: '1.4.489'\n          tinytex: true\n\n      - name: Install R\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n          r-version: '4.2.0'\n\n      - name: Install R Dependencies\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2\n        with:\n          cache-version: 1\n\n      - name: Install Python and Dependencies\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n        with:\n          python-version: '3.10'\n          cache: 'pip'\n      - run: pip install jupyter\n      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Push To GitLab\n        env:\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n        run: |\n          echo Starting to push gh-pages branch to GitLab\n          git config user.name \"maptv\"\n          git config user.email \"129316885+maptv@users.noreply.github.com\"\n          git remote set-url origin \"https://oauth2:${token}@gitlab.com/maptv/maptv.gitlab.io\"\n          git push origin gh-pages\n\n\n\n\nThe gh-pages.yml file in Example 7 installs Quarto, the R and Python programming languages, and the packages in the renv.lock and requirements.txt files. If you do not need R and/or Python, you can remove any unnecessary portions of the file.\nTo modify the Python files that are installed by GitHub Actions, you can edit the requirements.txt file in your repo. To update your renv.lock file so that it includes all of the R packages your site requires, run renv::snapshot() in an R session or Rscript -e renv::snapshot() in a shell.\nAfter pushing the gh-pages.yml file, you can visit the Actions tab in your remote repo on GitHub to check the progress of the deployment of your site. If your site did not build successfully, you can go through the logs to try to diagnose the problem.\nI added a “Push to GitLab” step to my gh-pages.yml to make GitHub Actions push my remote gh-pages to GitLab so that my site is kept in sync on both GitHub and GitLab Pages. This required manually creating a token on GitLab and adding it to GitHub, which I accomplished using the GitHub CLI as shown in Example 8.\n\nExample 8  \ngh secret set GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN\n\nAfter the setup described above, I now have two options for publishing my Quarto site: quarto publish and 2) git push. In addition to GitHub and GitLab Pages, both of these options automatically update my site on Netlify via N2.\nTo also automatically update my site on Quarto Pub, I created a separate GitHub Actions workflow by adding another YAML file to the .github/workflows directory in my repo. Example 9 shows my quarto-pub.yml file and the shell code that can be used to obtain it.\n\nExample 9  \n\ncurlquarto-pub.yml\n\n\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\ncd .github/workflows\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptv/maptv.github.io/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml\n\n\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [pages-build-deployment]\n    types: [completed]\n\nname: Update Quarto Pub\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out main repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Check out _site\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          ref: gh-pages\n          path: _site\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n\n      - name: Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: quarto-pub\n          render: false\n          QUARTO_PUB_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.QUARTO_PUB_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n          GITHUB_USERNAME: maptv\n\n\n\n\nMy quarto-pub.yml file is based on Q2, but it runs upon completion of the pages-build-deployment workflow instead of a push to main. I changed the workflow trigger so that it runs after my GitHub Pages site is built, regardless of whether I triggered the build by running quarto publish gh-pages or pushing to main.\nFigure 3 summarizes all of the steps that occur during my Quarto publishing workflow. This workflow allows me to publish my site on four web hosts every time I run quarto publish gh-pages (G2) or git push (G3)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G2.-&gt;B[local&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G2.-&gt;C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    B[local&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G2.-&gt;D[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;F[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G3.-&gt;D[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;G[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;main]\n    C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.N2.-&gt;E[Netlify]\n    C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.Q2.-&gt;H[Quarto&lt;br/&gt;Pub]\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Quarto publishing workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far I have only noticed one difference between the four web hosts I use for my site: GitHub Pages is the only web host that properly differentiates between internal and external links. All of the other web hosts include the external link icon on all links regardless of whether they target my site or an external site.\nI tried unsuccessfully to solve this issue by setting the link-external-filter property to a regular expression. If you notice a problem with the link-external-icon feature on other web hosts, I suggest switching to GitHub Pages.",

    "section": "Customizing Quarto sites",
    "text": "Customizing Quarto sites\n\nSite navigation\nOnce your site is built and published, you can make it easier to navigate with a customized navigation bar (navbar) and sidebar, as described in the Quarto documentation. Check out the _quarto.yml files for my site and the Quarto documentation site to see how the navigation components are set up.\nIn my navbar, I added toggle buttons for reader mode and dark mode. The names of the other icons on right side of the navbar are included in the sidebar.\n\n\nHTML blocks\nMy navbar also provides the current date and time in Dec ordinal (deco) format, which counts the years since 1 BC and the days since March 1. Dec is a calendar and time system that I created and use throughout my blog.\nTo add a custom timestamp to the navbar, I put a &lt;script&gt; element that runs time.js in an HTML block in every Quarto markdown (.qmd) file, as shown in Example 10. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel wrote about HTML blocks as part of her A Quarto tip a day project.\n\nExample 10  \n\n*.qmdtime.js\n\n\n```{=html}\n&lt;script src=\"time.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML blocks are useful for running JavaScript code in the context of a single page on your site without affecting the others. I also use HTML blocks to add a &lt;style&gt; element to my .qmd files as a last ditch effort to fine tune the style of my site.\nBefore I resort to the &lt;style&gt; element approach, I try writing CSS in my style.css, light.css, and dark.css files. So far, this approach has been sufficient to make any styling changes I want, but if it every fails, I can use JavaScript to override the default styling provided by Quarto by modifying style attributes, which have the highest specificity in CSS.\n\n\nPost-render script\nI wanted to my blog’s listing page to show dates in the same format as the navbar timestamp. To accomplish this, I used a post-render script written in the Python programming language.\nPre- and post-render scripts are set as project options in the _quarto.yml file in the root of your Quarto project. Example 11 shows the date.py post-render script and how this script is referenced in _quarto.yml.\n\nExample 11  \n\n_quarto.ymldate.py\n\n\nauthor:\n  - name: Martin Laptev\n    url: https://maptv.github.io\ndate-format: x\n\n\n# https://howardhinnant.github.io/date_algorithms.html#days_from_civil\nimport bs4\n\ndef unix2doty(ms):\n    dote = ms / 86400000 + 719468\n    cykl = (\n        dote if dote &gt;= 0\n        else dote - 146096\n    ) // 146097\n    dotc = dote - cykl * 146097\n    yotc = (dotc\n        - dotc // 1460\n        + dotc // 36524\n        - dotc // 146096\n    ) // 365\n    return [\n        int(yotc + cykl * 400),\n        dotc - (yotc * 365\n            + yotc // 4\n            - yotc // 100\n        )\n    ]\n\nwith open(\"_site/list/index.html\") as infile:\n    txt = infile.read()\n    soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(txt, features=\"html.parser\")\nfor div in soup.find_all(\"div\", {\"class\": \"card-file-modified\"}):\n    if \"+\" not in div.text:\n        y, d = unix2doty(int(div.text))\n        div.string.replace_with(f\"{y:&gt;04}+{d.__floor__():&gt;03}\")\nfor div in soup.find_all(\"div\", {\"class\": \"listing-reading-time\"}):\n    if \"min\" in div.text:\n        div.string.replace_with(f\"{(int(div.text.split()[0]) / 1.44).__floor__()} milliday\")\nwith open(\"_site/list/index.html\", \"w\") as outfile:\n    outfile.write(str(soup))\n\n\n\n\nNormally, formatting dates in Quarto is as easy as setting the date-format YAML property. In my case it was more difficult, because I wanted dates based on Dec, the calendar and time system I created, instead of the ubiquitous Gregorian calendar.\nTo facilitate the calculations in date.py, I set date-format to x in my _metadata.yml file so all of the dates would be in millisecond UNIX time and I would not have to deal with Gregorian calendar date formats or time zones. After all of the dates are generated, my date.py script traverses the HTML in the output directory using Beautiful Soup and converts millisecond UNIX time dates into Dec dates (year+day).\n\n\nPandoc filter\nIn addition to customizing dates on the listing page of my blog, I wanted to customize the date format in every blog post. To complete this task, I used a Lua script as a Pandoc filter.\nPandoc is a program that converts documents into practically any format. The “pan” in Pandoc comes from the Ancient Greek word for all. Pandoc strives to convert all document formats, just like Pangea contained all the land and a panacea solves all problems.\nQuarto uses Pandoc to convert markdown files into target format(s) like html or pdf. If the source files contain executable code, Quarto executes the code via one of two computational engines: Jupyter or Knitr. Figure 4 shows the Quarto workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[qmd&lt;br/&gt;ipynb]-.Knitr&lt;br/&gt;Jupyter.-&gt;B((md))-.Pandoc with&lt;br/&gt;Lua filters.-&gt;C(html&lt;br/&gt;pdf&lt;br/&gt;docx&lt;br/&gt;etc.)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Quarto rendering workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s Quarto tip series includes a similar Quarto workflow mermaid diagram and her “Hello, Quarto!” rstudio::conf(2022) keynote with Julia Stewart Lowndes contains truly beautiful Quarto workflow images by Allison Horst: 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nQuarto controls Pandoc, Jupyter, and Knitr in two ways: 1) with arguments passed to the Quarto CLI commands and 2) with YAML key-value pairs in .qmd, .ipynb, or .yml files.\nExample 12 shows how I set up every qmd file to generate the current date in millisecond UNIX time and designated date.lua as a Pandoc filter. Unlike post-render scripts, Pandoc filters are executed during the creation of the output files.\n\nExample 12  \n\n*.qmddate.lua\n\n\ndate: now\ndate-format: x\nfilters: date.lua\n\n\n-- https://howardhinnant.github.io/date_algorithms.html#days_from_civil\nfunction unix2deco(ms)\n  local dote = ms / 86400000 + 719468\n  local cykl = (\n    dote &gt;= 0 and dote\n    or dote - 146096\n  ) // 146097\n  local dotc = dote - cykl * 146097\n  local yotc = (\n    dotc - dotc // 1460\n    + dotc // 36524\n    - dotc // 146096\n  ) // 365\n  return string.format(\n    \"%s+%03d\",\n    math.floor(yotc + cykl * 400),\n    math.floor(dotc - (yotc * 365\n      + yotc // 4\n      - yotc // 100)))\nend\n\nlocal function to_decalendar(date)\n  local date = pandoc.utils.stringify(date)\n  local unix = date:match(\"(%d+)\")\n  return date:gsub(unix, unix2deco(unix))\nend\n\nfunction Meta(m)\n  m.date = to_decalendar(m.date)\n  return m\nend\n\n\n\n\nAll three of the customizations I described above convert millisecond UNIX time into a custom date format, but you can adapt these approaches to make all sorts of edits to your Quarto site. HTML blocks can run JavaScript which excels at making content dynamic and interactive, pre- and post-render scripts can be in any programming language, while Pandoc filters are written in Lua and modify output during rendering.\nComing up next on my blog is a post that Observable graphics.

    "text": "Day-of-the-year\nDecalendar1 is a decimal calendar🗓️system and Declock2 is a decimal timekeeping⏳system. Instead of months, weeks, hours, minutes, and seconds, Decalendar and Declock use a number called the day-of-the-year (doty)3. Figure 2 displays the current doty () as a bar chart. The integer part of the doty is the Decalendar date4 () and the fractional part is the Declock time5 ().\nThe top two bars in Figure 2 (旬 and 日) show the two components of the Decalendar date (): the dek6 () and the day-of-the-dek7 (). A dek is a group of 10 days that fulfills the role of months and weeks in Decalendar. Therefore, the dek and the day-of-the-dek (dotd) in Decalendar dates are analogous to the month and day-of-the-month (dotm) in calendar dates (mm-dd) and the week and day-of-the-week (dotw) in week dates (Www-d).\nThe bottom three bars in Figure 2 (%, ‰, and ♫) show components of the Declock time (): cents8 (), mils9 (), and beats10 (). A cent is 1% of the day, which is a little less than a quarter hour. A mil (‰) is a tenth of a cent, which is close to a minute and a half. A beat is 1% of a mil, which is almost as long as a second, and can be thought of as a heart❤️beat or musical🎵beat with a constant rate or tempo of 69.4̅ beats per minute.

Every 73 days, the Decalendar fractional year date increases by .2 (⅕). The current Decalendar fractional year date is .\nNow it’s your turn!

When a doty is combined with a year, it forms a Decalendar ordinal12 (deco) and represents a specific date (year+day) or time (year+day.stamp) in a specific year, instead of a date (day) or time (day.stamp) that occurs every year or every leap year. Using the Observable datetime input in Example 2, you can select a year, month, dotm, hour, and minute to see the equivalent 1) deco timestamp (year+day.clock) and 2) year date (year.yyy) in ../List 2. For comparison, the current deco timestamp is .\n\nExample 2  \n\n\n\nviewof inputDatetime = Inputs.datetime({label: \"date\", value: \"1970-01-01T00:00\"})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n../List 2: Date and time conversion\n\n\n\n\nIn Example 3, you can enter numeric year and doty values or type in a free-form deco to see the resulting 1) ISO 8601 timestamp (year-mm-ddThh:mm:ss) and 2) year date in ../List 3. Example 3 also has a Play▶️button in that cycles from Day 0 to Day 365 of Year 1969. The cycle goes up to Day 0 of Year 1970, because Year 1969 is a common year and does not have a Day 365.\nInteracting with the number inputs in Example 3, standardizes the deco in the text input to ensure years are integers and doty values are positive numbers below 366. Nevertheless, all of the inputs in Example 3 support negative and fractional year and doty values. Negative doty values shift dates backward in time from the start of a given year into a previous year.

    "text": "Dek\nAs mentioned in Section 0.3, deks function as both months and weeks in Decalendar. A dek consists of 2 groups of 5 days called pents13. Each pent can follow a sequence of workdays and restdays called a pently schedule14. fig-schedules compares the typical weekly schedule and the Schedule 3 pently schedule. Like other pently schedules, Schedule 3 is named after the number of workdays it contains. The 3 workdays in Schedule 3 are followed by a 2-day pentend, the Decalender equivalent of a weekend.\nUnlike Schedule 3 and the other pently schedules, the weekly schedule is asymmetric and divides up workdays into proportions that are easier to express as fractions: 3/8 (.375), 1/3 (.3̅), and 7/24 (0.2916̅). In contrast, pently schedules divides each workday into simple, symmetrical proportions that are never repeating decimal numbers. The Schedule 3 workday is longer the typical 9-to-5, but the longer workday is compensated by more frequent restdays.\nExample 4 provides the opportunity to explore all four of the pently schedules. Schedule 3 is the default pently schedule, and should be followed unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise. Despite having different numbers of workdays, all pently schedules keep the amount of spent at work constant at 1.2 days (120 cents) per pent. Every pently schedule also splits up workdays symmetrically so that the time before work is equal to the time after work. You can select which schedule to view in Example 4 using the Observable radio inputs.\nYou can also use the interval sliders to create a custom schedule and the Download⬇️button to obtain the schedule data. Each interval is summarized by a Declock slice shown next to its slider. Decalendar and Declock slices are inspired by array slicing in computer programming and are used to represent date and time intervals. The slice that summarizes the Schedule 3 workday is .3:.7, where .3 (7.2 hours) is the start and .7 (16.8 hours) is the stop.\n\nExample 4  \n\n\n\nviewof intervals = Inputs.form([\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [.3, .7], label: '0 or 5', width: 250, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}:${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [.3, .7], label: '1 or 6', width: 250, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}:${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [.3, .7], label: '2 or 7', width: 250, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}:${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [0, 0], label: '3 or 8', width: 250, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}:${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [0, 0], label: '4 or 9', width: 250, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}:${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof schedule = Inputs.radio([2, 3, 4, 5], {label: \"sched.\", value: 3})\n\nviewof filename = Inputs.text({label: \"name\", placeholder: \"Enter the filename\", value: `schedule${schedule}.csv`})\n\nbutton(durations, filename)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// https://observablehq.com/@dec/pent\nPlot.plot({\n  className: \"schedule-explorer\",\n  x: {label: null},\n  color: {scheme: \"Set1\", legend: \"swatches\", reverse: true},\n  y: {label: null, domain: [1, 0]},\n  marks: [\n  Plot.barY(durations, {x: \"label\", y: \"duration\", fill: \"group\"}),\n  Plot.textY(\n      durations,\n      Plot.stackY(\n        Plot.groupX(\n          { y: \"first\", text: \"first\" },\n          {\n            x: \"label\",\n            z: \"group\",\n            y: \"duration\",\n            text: (d) =&gt; (d.duration &lt; .0001 ? null : formatDecimal(d.duration)),\n            fill: \"white\",\n            stroke: \"black\",\n            fontSize: 36,\n          }\n        )\n      )\n    ),\n  ]})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Pently schedule explorer\n\n\n\n\n\nSlices can be used to select Declock time intervals, as in Example 4 above, or Decalendar date intervals, as in Example 5 below. Decalendar date intervals can represent events take place over multiple days. In addition to slices, Decalendar and Declock intervals can also be chosen using spreads. Use the Observable button and checkbox inputs in Example 5 to display different dotd combinations in Figure 4. Figure 4 shows dates selected by a slice in blue, dates selected by a spread in orange, dates selected by both in green, and dates selected by neither in gray.\nThe Example 5 button and checkbox inputs will modify the associated slice and spread text and numeric inputs as needed to select the desired days-of-the-dek. The numeric inputs for slices are the start🎬index, the stop🛑index, and the step👣size, which are separated by colons (start:stop:step) when combined into a slice. Similarly, the numeric inputs for spreads are the start🎬or🛑stop index, the span🪽size, the split size, and the space size, which are typically delimited by greater-than signs (start&gt;span&gt;split&gt;space) or a mix of greater-than and less-than signs (stop&lt;span&gt;split&gt;space).\nThe numeric inputs in Example 5 cannot capture the full power of spreads and slices, because slices can have any number of steps and, likewise, spreads can have any number of alternating split and space sizes. We can select all even or odd days-of-the-dek using a slice with a single step (::2 or 1::2) or a spread with one split-space pair (&gt;&gt;&gt;1 or 1&gt;&gt;&gt;1). More complex patterns, such as prime or composite days-of-the-dek, require multiple step sizes for slices (2:::2:2:5 or 4::2:2::5) or multiple split-space pairs (2&gt;&gt;2&gt;1&gt;&gt;1&gt;&gt;4 or 4&gt;&gt;&gt;1&gt;&gt;1&gt;2&gt;4).\n\nExample 5  \n\nviewof sliceDotd = Inputs.checkbox([...Array(10).keys()], {label: \"slice\", value: [1, 6]})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof spreadDotd = Inputs.checkbox([...Array(10).keys()], {label: \"spread\", value: [1, 6]})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof togglePlot = Inputs.button([\n  [invertDotd ? \"None\" : \"All\", value =&gt; [...Array(10).keys()]],\n  [invertDotd ? \"Even\" : \"Odd\", value =&gt; [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]],\n  [invertDotd ? html`&lt;s&gt;Prime&lt;/s&gt;` : \"Prime\", value =&gt; [2, 3, 5, 7]],\n  [invertDotd ? html`&lt;s&gt;Composite&lt;/s&gt;` : \"Composite\", value =&gt; [4, 6, 8, 9]],\n  [invertDotd ? html`&lt;s&gt;Schedule2&lt;/s&gt;` : \"Schedule2\", value =&gt; [0, 1, 5, 6]],\n  [invertDotd ? html`&lt;s&gt;Schedule3&lt;/s&gt;` : \"Schedule3\", value =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7]],\n  [invertDotd ? html`&lt;s&gt;Schedule4&lt;/s&gt;` : \"Schedule4\", value =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]],\n], {value: [], label: \"select\"})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof invertDotd = Inputs.toggle({label: \"invert\"})\nviewof sliceOrSpread = toggleSwitch({textOn: invertDotd ? \"Spread\" : 'Slice' , textOff: invertDotd ? \"Slice\" : 'Spread'})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof sliceInputs = Inputs.form([\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"start\", value: 1, placeholder: \"Enter start index\"}),\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"stop\", value: 366, placeholder: \"Enter stop index\"}),\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"step\", value: 5, placeholder: \"Enter step size\"}),\n])\nviewof sliceString = transformInput(\n  Inputs.text({label: \"slice\", placeholder: \"Enter slice string\", value: \"0:366\"}),\n{bind: viewof sliceInputs, transform: encodeSlice, invert: decodeSlice});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof spreadInputs = Inputs.form([\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"start\", value: 0, placeholder: \"Enter start index\"}),\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"span\", value: 366, placeholder: \"Enter span size\"}),\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"split\", value: 3, placeholder: \"Enter split size\"}),\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"space\", value: 2, placeholder: \"Enter space size\"}),\n])\nviewof spreadString = transformInput(\n  Inputs.text({label: \"spread\", placeholder: \"Enter spread string\", value: \"0&gt;366&gt;3&gt;2\"}),\n{bind: viewof spreadInputs, transform: encodeSpread, invert: decodeSpread});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// https://observablehq.com/@dec/dotd\nPlot.plot({\n  className: \"date-selector\",\n  padding: 0,\n  x: {axis: \"top\", label: null, type: \"band\"},\n  y: {label: null, type: \"band\"},\n  marks: [\n    Plot.cell(dates, {x: d =&gt; d[2], y: d =&gt; d.slice(0, 2), fill: d =&gt;\n      sliceArray.includes(d) && spreadArray.includes(d) ? \"green\" :\n      sliceArray.includes(d) && !spreadArray.includes(d) ? \"blue\" :\n      !sliceArray.includes(d) && spreadArray.includes(d) ? \"orange\" : \"grey\",\n      inset: 0.5}),\n    Plot.text(dates, {\n    x: d =&gt; d[2],\n    y: d =&gt; d.slice(0, 2),\n    fill: \"white\",\n    stroke: \"black\",\n    fontSize: 20})\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Decalendar date selector",

    "text": "Introduction\nGit is a version control system developed by Linux creator Linus Torvalds. Since its first release in 2005+037, Git has largely replaced other version control systems and is used by 93% of software developers worldwide, according to survey results published by StackOverflow on 2022+314.\nThanks to Git, I can sleep💤soundly at night, reassured by the knowledge that all of my progress on all of my ongoing projects is recorded. My progress is not only stored on my local computer, but also on Git repository hosts such as GitHub and GitLab.\nA Git repository (repo) is a directory that tracks the changes made to its contents. For more information on GitHub, the largest Git repo host, take a look at the “GitHub for supporting, reusing, contributing, and failing safely” post by Allison Horst and Julie Lowndes on the Openscapes blog.\nGitHub and GitLab do not only host repos, but also websites via GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages. In addition to providing basic web hosting for free, GitHub and GitLab offer free access to continuous integration (CI) systems called GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD that can automatically build and deploy software.\nAnother advantage of using Git is the availability of free web-based editors, such as github.dev, vscode.dev, and Web IDE, that make it possible to modify repo contents via a web browser without the need to keep local copies of repos or have anything installed locally. Cloud-based computing platforms like GitHub Codespaces and GitPod offer the same benefits of web-based editors, but also provide compute for running code and building software, thus enabling remote development on any computer with a web browser.\nBefore you can benefit from everything GitHub and/or GitLab have to offer, you will need to set up your computer so that you can work locally and/or configure a service like GitHub Codespaces or GitLab Web IDE for remote development in your web browser. In this post, I discuss local development environment setup with the Homebrew package manager and repo setup with the GitHub and GitLab CLI.\nIf you follow along to end of this post, you will have a repo called dotfiles that can be used for Codespaces and GitPod setup. I cover how to set up Codespaces and GitPod in my next blog post, which focuses on the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and VSCodium source-code editors.",

    "text": "Setup\n\nHomebrew\nLinux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) users can install everything needed to work through all of the examples in this blog post via the Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager. First, install Homebrew itself with the latest .pkg installer for macOS or by running the Example 1 Unix shell code in your terminal.\n\nExample 1  \n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://\\\nraw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/\\\ninstall/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nIf you are not completely satisfied with the terminal that comes with your operating system (OS), you can use Homebrew to install a new terminal. The terminals I use most often are the iTerm2 standalone terminal and the integrated terminal built into my preferred source-code editor VSCodium. Unfortunately, iTerm2 is only for macOS, but there is an abundance of great multi-OS standalone terminals, such as Alacritty, Hyper, Kitty, and Tabby.\nAfter installing Homebrew, you can run brew doctor in your terminal to confirm that everything is set up correctly. If the brew command is not available, you need to follow the instructions provided after installation to add brew to your PATH variable.\nOnce Homebrew is ready, you can run the shell code in Example 2 to create a file called Brewfile with the echo shell command and install everything listed in this newly created Brewfile with the brew bundle shell command.\n\nExample 2  \necho 'brew \"gh\"\\nbrew \"git\"\nbrew \"glab\"\\ncask \"github\"' &gt; Brewfile\nbrew bundle\n\nThe Brewfile created by the shell code in Example 2 installs:\n\nGit,\nthe command line interfaces (CLIs) for\n\nGitHub and\nGitLab, and\n\nthe GitHub Desktop Git Graphical User Interface (GUI).\n\nAfter installing Git, you should go through the First-Time Git Setup or make sure you have a Git configuration file with the correct name and location, either ~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config, where ~ represents the home directory and / is the directory delimiter used in Unix paths. When configuring Git, I recommend that you set your default editor to VSCode (code) or VSCodium (codium) as shown in Example 3.\n\nExample 3  \n\nShell.gitconfig\n\n\ngit config --global core.editor \"codium --wait\"\n\n\n[core]\n    editor = codium --wait\n\n\n\n\nIf you are curious about how I set up my computer, you can take a look at my Brewfile, .gitconfig, and other configuration files in my setup repo on GitHub and GitLab. In particular, I will highlight my Z shell configuration file (.zshrc) in Section 5.\n\n\nAuthentication\nBefore we get started, you will need to have created an account on GitHub and/or GitLab. You will need two authentication methods: 1) to sign into github.com or gitlab.com in your browser and 2) to run the git push shell command in your terminal. For git push to work, you will need either a Personal Access Token (PAT) or a Secure Shell (SSH) key.\nCreating a PAT on GitHub or GitLab is easy, but then you must also store your PAT in Keychain Access on Mac or Git Credential Manager on Windows and Linux to avoid having to enter your PAT every time you run git push in your terminal. In contrast, setting up an SSH key on GitHub or GitLab requires much more effort but you can set up a single SSH key and reuse it for GitHub, GitLab, and any other service that supports authentication via SSH key.\nWhen I set up a new computer, I create a SSH key using the command in ?@exm-keygen. I can add this key to my SSH agent simply by running ssh-add, but I also\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C \\((uname -n)_\\)(sysctl hw.model | cut -f2 -d )\nI use the\nIf you enter an empty passphrase when creating your SSH key, then you will not need Keychain Access or Git Credential Manager. frictionless experience by default, whereas PATs are more difficult than need to entered every time your. This major limitation of PATs can be circumvented by storing your PAT in Keychain Access on Mac or Git Credential Manager on Windows and Linux.\nThe instructions for setting up an SSH key can use your newly created key for both GitHub and GitLab, but if you have more than one account on the same Git repo host, you will need to create a separate key for each account and include each identity file in your ~/.ssh/config file as shown in Example 5.\nI can add this key that one SSH key is named ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk, or ~/.ssh/id_dsa.\nIso I can add it to my SSH agent simply by running ssh-add. unless I need to sign into multiple accounts on the same Git repository host.\nFor example, if I have separate accounts for work and personal projects, I create a separate SSH key for each account and include each identity file in my ~/.ssh/config file as shown in Example 5. If including “AddKeysToAgent yes” does not automatically add your SSH keys to your SSH agent, run ssh-add ~/.ssh/USERNAME to add each SSH key.\n\nExample 4  \n\n\n~/.ssh/config\n\nHost github-WORKUSERNAME\n    AddKeysToAgent yes\n    HostName github.com\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/WORKUSERNAME\n    IdentitiesOnly yes\n\nHost github-PERSONALUSERNAME\n    AddKeysToAgent yes\n    HostName github.com\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/PERSONALUSERNAME\n    IdentitiesOnly yes\n\n\nOf the many authentication methods, passkeys stand out because they can function as both a password and two-factor authentication (2FA), thus combining the two steps in the 2FA sign-in process into one. Passkeys will certainly become more common in the future, especially now that GitHub recently announced its plan to make 2FA mandatory for code contributors.\nWhen authenticating via SSH, we use SSH URLs, such as git@github.com:maptv/dotfiles.With PATs, we use HTTPS URLs such as https://github.com/maptv/dotfiles, instead of the\n\nExample 5  \n\n\n~/.ssh/config\n\nHost github-USERNAME1\n   HostName github.com\n   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/USERNAME1\n   IdentitiesOnly yes\n\nHost github-USERNAME2\n   HostName github.com\n   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/USERNAME2\n   IdentitiesOnly yes\n\n\nIf you have an identity file in your ~/.ssh/ directory that follows the naming convention, you can add it to your current shell session by running ssh-add. If not, you will need to provide the identity file as an argument, e.g. ssh-add ~/.ssh/USERNAME1.\nYou can create a repo using the web interface of https://github.com or https://gitlab.com in your browser, but the best way to start a new project is using the CLI for GitHub or GitLab in your terminal. First, run gh auth login or glab auth login and follow the prompts to authenticate via your web browser or with an authentication token.\nThe GitHub CLI allows you to add an SSH key to your account during or after authentication. The GitLab CLI does not handle SSH keys during authentication, but has a similar command for adding an SSH key to your GitLab account.\n\n\nRepository\nAfter authentication and SSH key setup, you can run the code in either of the code chunks in Example 6 to set up your local and remote repos and create a Quarto website project in the local repo. You can create shell alias that combine all of the repo creation steps like I did in my .zshrc.\n\nExample 6  \n\nGitHubGitLab\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\ngh repo create REPONAME --add-readme --clone --public\ncd REPONAME\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\nglab repo create REPONAME --readme --defaultBranch main --public\ncd REPONAME\ngit pull origin main\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to backup my repos on both GitHub and GitLab, I set up each local repo to have two origin remote URLs using the code as shown in Example 7. With this setting, running git push in my local repo updates my remote repos on both GitHub and GitLab.\n\nExample 7  \ngit remote add lab git@gitlab.com:maptv/maptv.gitlab.io\ngit remote add hub git@github.com:maptv/maptv.github.io\ngit remote set-url --add origin $(git remote get-url lab)",

    "text": "Git workflow\nWhen I want to add or update the content on my site, I go through the steps in the standard Git workflow shown in Figure 2. Every time I “push” a collection of changes called a commit to my maptv.github.io repo on GitHub, a continuous integration (CI) system called GitHub Actions automatically completes the steps required to build and publish my website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[working&lt;br/&gt;directory]-.git&lt;br/&gt;add.-&gt;B{{staging&lt;br/&gt;area}}-.git&lt;br/&gt;commit.-&gt;C([local&lt;br/&gt;repo])-.git&lt;br/&gt;push.-&gt;D(remote&lt;br/&gt;repo)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Git workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShell aliases\nTo make it easier to make incremental changes to my website and frequently release new content, I combined all of the git shell commands in Figure 2 into shell aliases. You can add shell aliases to a shell configuration file like .bashrc or .zshrc on your computer to shorten one or more commands and any associated command arguments.\nThe git commit aliases in the .zshrc file in my setup repo on GitHub and GitLab target different groups of files for inclusion in the next commit. For example, cmp targets staged files, camp targets tracked files, a.cmp targets files in the current directory, and aacmp targets files in the repo.\nExample 8 shows the aacmp alias as an example of the shell alias syntax. The mnemonic device for this alias is add all, commit with a message, and push.\n\nExample 8  \n\n\n.zshrc\n\nalias aacmp=\"func() { git add --all && git commit --message \\\n    \\\"$(echo '${*:-$(echo $(git diff --name-status --cached \\\n    | tr \"[:space:]\" \" \"))}')\\\" && git push; }; func\"\n\n\nAliases like aacmp allow me to enter free-form commit messages directly on the command line without quotes, e.g. aacmp edit first post. If you decide to try one of these aliases, please exercise extreme caution as any un-escaped or un-quoted metacharacters may yield surprising effects instead of being included verbatim in the commit message, e.g. * is replaced by all of the file and directory names in the current directory!\nIf no commit message is provided after the aliases, a generic commit message is created that includes the change type and name of each changed file. In Section 5.2, I describe how I used this generic commit message approach to further simplify the Git workflow.\n\n\nKeybindings\nAn alternative to a shell alias that combines git commands is to use a keyboard shortcut in a Git Graphical User Interface (GUI) such as GitHub Desktop or the Git interface in a code editor like VSCode, VSCodium, or RStudio. I use keyboard shortcuts in VSCode and VSCodium to send shell commands to the integrated terminal without moving my focus away from the files I am editing.\nI created different shortcuts to control which files are included in each commit: ⌥⇧F for the current file only, ⌥⇧S for already staged files, ⌥⇧T for all tracked files, and ⌥⇧U for all files including untracked files. I also have keyboard shortcuts that affect a specific directory (and all of its subdirectories): ⌥⇧D for the current file’s directory, ⌥⇧. for shell’s current directory, ⌥⇧C for the current working directory according to VSCode/VSCodium, ⌥⇧W for the Workspace directory.\nExample 9 displays the ⌥⇧F shortcut as an example of the VSCode/VSCodium shortcut syntax. This shortcut uses the escape code for the return key (\\u000D) to run several git commands and predefined variables to insert the absolute (${file}) and relative (${relativeFile}) path to the currently open file.\n\nExample 9  \n\n\nkeybindings.json\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"shift+alt+f\",\n  \"command\": \"workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence\", \"args\": { \"text\":\n    \"git add ${file} && git commit -m \\\"M ${relativeFile}\\\" && git push\\u000D\" },\n  \"when\": \"terminalIsOpen\"\n}\n\n\nIf you want to set up similar shortcuts for yourself, take a look at my keybindings.json in my setup repo on GitHub and GitLab. As you create keyboard shortcuts, please be mindful of keybinding conflicts that may arise.\nTo set up a keyboard shortcut that runs a series of steps rather than a single line of shell code, I suggest you use the VSCode/VSCodium Tasks mechanism, a system designed to automate software build tasks. The default keyboard shortcut to run all tasks in a local or global task.json file is ⌃⇧B on Linux/Windows or ⌘⇧B on Mac (mnemonic: B is for Build), but you can bind other shortcuts to specific tasks.\nIf you use a text editor like Vim or Emacs, you can create keybindings for Vim plugins like fugitive or Emacs packages like magit that run through the entire Git workflow. Example 10 shows the Vim+fugitive equivalent of my ⌥⇧F VSCode/VSCodium keybinding.\n\nExample 10  \n\n\n.vimrc\n\nnnoremap &lt;A-S-f&gt; :Gw&lt;bar&gt;G! commit -m \"M \"%&lt;bar&gt;G! push&lt;CR&gt;\n\n\nThe drawback of my keyboard shortcut approach for the Git workflow is that it produces generic commit messages that are no very informative. Anyone reading the messages will not be able to tell what changes were made and more importantly why the changes were made.\nTo automatically generate commit messages based on the currently staged changes, we can use a Large Language Model (LLM). Generative artificial intelligence models like LLMs tend to be large in size and have atypical computational requirements, so I will save my adventures with LLMs for a different post.\nI really enjoy using Git, especially with shell aliases in my terminal and keyboard shortcuts in my favorite text editors. If we ever collaborate on a project together, you can be sure that I will insist on using Git!",

I use several clever hacks to get Quarto to display all of the dates on my website in the Dec year+day format. Knowing the basics of the Dec calendar🗓️(Decalendar) will help you to understand the filter, include, and script articles in the Quarto section of my site.\nAmong its many features, Quarto offers support for the Observable data visualization system. Observable is my top choice for interactive graphics. We can interact with the two Observable calendar🗓️plots below⬇️using the adjacent Observable inputs. The scrubber🧽input is a great place to start because it cycles🔄through every value of the range🎚️inputs beneath it.\nTo activate the scrubber🧽input, press the Play▶️button above⬆️the range🎚️inputs. Upon activation, the red🟥box in each plot will move between the first and the last day of the Dec year. While it always begins with Day 0, the Dec year ends with either Day 364 or Day 365. To add or remove Day 365, use the toggle✅input labelled🏷️“Leap year” to the right of the Play▶️button.\nThe “Leap year” toggle✅input shifts 306 dates, Day 0 to Day 305, in the Gregorian calendar🗓️by one day, but does not change the order of any Dec dates, because Day 365 is the last day of Dec leap years and is always followed by Day 0 of the subsequent Dec year. The “Vertical layout” toggle✅input rotates the plots by a quarter turn, interchanging the x- and y-axes.\nThe axis labels🏷️of the plots imply that a dek and a “day of dek” (dod) are analogous to a week and a “day of week” (dow). Indeed, deks are groups of ten days that serve as the Dec analog of both weeks and months.

Changing the Day 306 dow shifts every date in the Gregorian calendar🗓️by one to six days depending on the number of days that Week 0, the first week of the year, contributes to the year. In contrast, weeks have no effect on Decalendar.\nAlthough weeks determine the shape of the Gregorian calendar🗓️plot, each of its cell values is a “day of month” (dom). To uniquely identify🪪a specific day in a year, a dom must be paired with the month to which it belongs. Both plots use three-letter abbreviations and the same color🎨scheme to label🏷️months, but are shifted in relation to each other by two months.\n\nDay of year (doy)\nA dek and dod can be combined into a single integer called a “day of year” (doy). Every cell value in the Decalendar plot is a doy. The doy chosen by the range🎚️inputs to be highlighted with a red🟥background in the plots is . You can use the range🎚️inputs to convert a month and a dom into a doy. Try converting a special date such as your birthday🎂 or anniversary💍!\nThere are two range🎚️inputs labeled🏷️as “day of year” because every doy can be expressed as both a positive and a negative number. The typical range for doys is 0 to n-1, but negative doys typically range from -n to -1, where n is the number of days in the year, either 365 or 366. A doy outside these bounds represents a day in a previous or subsequent year.\nThe current doy can be expressed as  or . The difference between any positive doy and its negative equivalent is n:  -  = . We obtain the current dek via the dek equation,  = ⌊ ÷ 10⌋, and the current dod number via the dod equation:  =  mod 10. To combine a dek and dod, we multiply the dek by ten and add the dod:  =  × 10 + .\n\\[\\text{doy} = \\text{dek} \\times 10 + \\text{doy}\\]\n\\[\\text{dek} = \\lfloor \\text{doy} \\div 10 \\rfloor\\]\n\\[\\text{dod} = \\text{doy mod } 10\\]\nUnlike weeks in the Gregorian calendar🗓️, doys and deks do not need to continue in an infinite unbroken sequence. The last day of the year, Day -1, is always followed by Day 0, regardless of the last 4 or 5 days of Dek 36 that extend past the end of the year. If we want to track days seamlessly across years, we can use a continuous count of days called the “day of era” (doe).\n\n\nDay of era (doe)\nA doe is essentially a Julian day number (JDN) with a different epoch. We can convert a JDN to a doe by subtracting 1721119.5 days to shift the epoch from -4713+268.5 to 0000+000.0. To turn a UNIX timestamp into a doe, we divide by 86400 to convert seconds to days and then add 719468.0 to account for the fact that the UNIX epoch is 1969+306.0.\nDec uses does for calculations, such as finding the POSIX zero-based dow of a given date. This year, the dow of Christmas🎄is  according to the Dec dow equation: ( + 3) mod 7 = . As opposed to the “week of year” (woy) or dow associated with a given date, we can find the dek and the dod that correspond to a doy without any calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningBad Pun Alert\n\n\n\nDek the halls with dows of holly! Fa + la × 8!\n\n\nChristmas🎄is a anchored⚓️holiday because it occurs on the same doy every year. In contrast, floating🛟holidays happen on a different doy every year so that their dow can remain constant. Dec uses the dow delta equation, wΔ = (wM - wS + 7) mod 7, to determine which of the seven possible floating🛟holiday dates corresponds to the given year.\nIn the dow delta equation, wM is the minuend dow destination and wS is the subtrahend dow starting point. To get the doy of the first Dow 4 after Day 265, which is Thanksgiving🦃in the United States and Brazil, we plug 4 as wM and , the dow of Day 266 this year, as wS into the dow delta equation,  = (4 -  + 7) mod 7, and then add wΔ to 266:  =  + 266.\n\nYear of era (yoe)\nApart from the dow and dow delta equations, the Thanksgiving🦃calculation above⬆️relies on the Dec doe equation, which is based on the days_from_civil algorithm created by Howard Hinnant and described in his manuscript entitled chrono-Compatible Low-Level Date Algorithms, to convert a “year of era” (yoe), cycle of era (coe), year of cycle (yoc), and doy into a doe:\n\\[\\text{coe} = \\Biggl \\lfloor \\frac{\\begin{cases}\\text{yoe}&{\\text{if } \\text{yoe} \\geq 0;}\\\\\\text{yoe}-399&{\\text{otherwise.}}\\end{cases}}{400} \\Biggr \\rfloor\\]\n\\[\\text{yoc} = \\text{yoe} - \\text{coe} \\times 400\\]\n\n\\[\\text{doe} = \\text{coe}\\times146097 + \\text{yoc}\\times365 + \\lfloor\\frac{\\text{yoc}}{4}\\rfloor - \\lfloor\\frac{\\text{yoc}}{100}\\rfloor + \\text{doy}\\]\n\nThe Dec date equations are the inverse🔁of the Dec doe equations above⬆️, based on Howard Hinnant’s civil_from_days algorithm, and useful for obtaining Dec dates from does and doe analogs like UNIX timestamps and JDNs. Besides the coe and yoc, the Dec date equations also use the “day of cycle” (doc) of a doe to produce its corresponding yoe and doy:\n\\[\\text{coe} = \\Biggl \\lfloor \\frac{\\begin{cases}\\text{doe}&{\\text{if } \\text{doe} \\geq 0;}\\\\\\text{doe}-146096&{\\text{otherwise.}}\\end{cases}}{146097} \\Biggr \\rfloor\\]\n\\[\\text{doc} = \\text{doe} - \\text{coe} \\times 146097\\]\n\\[\\text{yoc} = \\biggl \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{doc} - \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{doc}}{1460} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{doc}}{36524} \\rfloor - \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{doc}}{146096} \\rfloor}{365} \\biggr \\rfloor\\]\n\\[\\text{yoe} = \\text{yoc} + \\text{coe} \\times 400\\]\n\\[\\text{doy} = \\biggl \\lfloor \\text{doc} - \\text{yoc} \\times 365 - \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{yoc}}{4} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{yoc}}{100} \\rfloor \\biggr \\rfloor\\]\nDates generated by the Dec date equations are guaranteed to be in the standard yoe+doy format. Therefore, we can standardize Dec dates by using the Dec doe and date equations consecutively to perform a round-trip “date to doe to date” conversion. Dec date standardization ensures that yoes are integers and doys are positive integers less than n.\nWhile n can be useful for converting between positive and negative doys or between days and fractional years, Dec dates do not include n, because it is not needed to specify a date, remains constant for 366, 1095, or 2920 days, has only 2 possible values: 365 or 366, and can be determined by passing yoe+1 to the Dec year length equation:\n\\[\\text{n}=\\begin{cases}\n  366&{\\begin{align}\\text{if } (\\text{yoe}+1)\\text{ mod }\\ \\ \\ \\ 4=0\\\\ \\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction}{\\land}(\\text{yoe}+1)\\text{ mod }100\\neq0\\\\\n  \\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction}{\\lor}( \\text{yoe}+1)\\text{ mod }400=0\\end{align}}\\\\\\\\\n  365&{\\text{otherwise.}}\\end{cases}\\]\nTo maintain balanced accounting of years and days, we need to add one to the yoe when we subtract n from a positive doy to make it negative. Likewise, we have to subtract one from the yoe when we add n to a positive doy to make it positive. The negative doy in the current Dec date, -, tells us that Year  will begin in  days.\nThe distinction between positive and negative doys can also be explained in terms of computer programming. If we think of a year as an array, n is the number of elements in the array and doys are like positive or negative index array indexes that can be used to obtain specific array elements individually via indexing or in groups via array slicing.\nIn Dec, a date without a yoe is a floating🛟date and a date that includes a yoe is an anchored⚓️date. To reuse♻️an anchored date in a different year, we have to update its yoe. In contrast, a floating date that does not contain any unreusable🗑️elements, such as the date of a floating holiday, a woy, or a dow, can be reused in any year without any modification.\nThanks to a method called minuend expansion, Dec dates can display many different kinds of information. In essense, minuend expansion replaces a minuend with a subtrahend and a difference. In the context of a rocket🚀launch, the current time is the minuend, the planned launch time is the subtrahend, and the “T-minus” countdown is the difference.\nFor example, we can create a expanded date which tells us that  days  Day 299🎄of this year: +299. Instead of an expanded date, we can express this same information as a Dec span: =+299. Unlike dates, Dec spans represent time intervals and are structured like an equation as opposed to a math expression.\nDec spans can omit either the minuend, as shown above, the subtrahend: , or the difference: +299. When the yoe is the same on both sides of the equals sign, it can be omitted from either the minuend or the subtrahend. If we omit the yoe from the subtrahend, we must also omit the difference: =299.\nDec spans can omit both the minuend and difference to indicate that the minuend is the first day of the year: Day 0. Similarly, an empty “right-hand side” (rhs) means that the subtrahend is the last day of the year: Day -1. Anchored spans have one or two yoes, whereas floating spans do not contain a yoe. The floating version of the span above would be =299.\nThe simplest possible span is just an equals sign and represents all the days in the year, from Day 0 to Day -1. If the year is unspecified, we will not know whether Day -1 is Day 364 or Day 365, but even if we do know, we might still want to keep the rhs blank for brevity. The span += only contains the current year but is equivalent to -.\nA span can display expanded dates, spans can display a minuend. Without a minuend, visually parsing a doy into a dek and dod may be harder. In this way, an expanded date deemphasizes its dek and dod in favor of some other information.\nUnlike a date or a span that shows a dom, a date or a span that shows a dow is not reusable️, because there are fourteen different yearly patterns of woys and dows that repeat every six to forty years.\n\n\n\nDay of week (dow)\nEven though Decalendar functions best with deks, Dec dates can display POSIX zero-based dows. Instead of the current Dec date, +, the navigation bar (navbar) of my site displays the current Dec dow date, +, by splitting the current doy, , into the doy of the first day of the current week (Dow 0 doy), , and the current POSIX dow: .\nInstead of the doy d, Dec dow dates display d-w+w, where d-w is the Dow 0 doy and w is the dow associated with d. We evaluate the subtraction, d-w, to obtain the Dow 0 doy, but leave the addition unsimplified so we can see w. Dec dow dates supply all of the information needed to identify specific dates and coordinate schedules based on deks or weeks.\nThe dow equation, dow = (doe + 3) mod 7, is derived from Howard Hinnant’s weekday_from_days algorithm. The Dec epoch dow is 3 = (0 + 3) mod 7. The UNIX epoch dow is 4 = (719468 + 3) mod 7. Depending on how mod is defined, a negative doe could yield a negative dow: -1 = (-60 + 3) mod 7. To convert a negative dow into a positive dow, we add 7.\n\n\n\n\nSunday\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\nSaturday\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek of year (woy)\nDec dow dates can be further expanded to include Dec woy numbers: +7×+. The current woy, , is the sum of the Dow 0 doy, , and the first dow of the year (Day 0 dow), , divided by 7:  = ( + ) ÷ 7. The current Dec floating🛟woy date, 7×+, is equal to the sum of the current doy and the Day 0 dow: 7 ×  +  =  + .\nTo create a Dec woy date, we need two types of Dec expansion: minuend and dividend expansion. First, we turn the minuend d into the subtrahend d-w and the difference w. Then, we use the dividend equation, dividend = divisor × quotient, to convert the dividend d-w+w0 into the divisor 7 and the quotient W, where W is the woy and w0 is the Day 0 dow.\nEssentially, Dec woy dates turn d-w into 7×W+w-w0. Typically, only 7×W+w is displayed, because w0 is not necessary to identify a date and can be calculated from a given y by flooring it, turning it into a doe, and passing it into the dow equation. Dec woy dates obfuscate🫣d much more than dow dates, but may be useful for week-based accounting🧾.\n\n\nDay of dek (dod)\nWhile weeks are not evenly divisible by two, a dek can be cut✂️into two equal halves called pentadays (pents). The Mermaid flowcharts below⬇️show Schedule 3, the recommended dekly schedule of work and rest day. Schedule 3 can be short for Schedule 1+3+1, if you prefer the zero-based top flowchart, or Schedule 3+2, if you favor the one-based bottom flowchart.\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'default', 'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '29px'}}}%%\nflowchart TB\n   A[0]--&gt;B[1]--&gt;C[2]--&gt;D[3]--&gt;E[4]\n   F[5]--&gt;G[6]--&gt;H[7]--&gt;I[8]--&gt;J[9]\n   subgraph workdays[work days]\n   B\n   C\n   G\n   H\n   D\n   I\n   end\n   subgraph restdays[rest days]\n   A\n   F\n   E\n   J\n   workdays\n   end\n   style restdays color:transparent;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'default', 'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '29px'}}}%%\nflowchart TB\n   B[1]--&gt;C[2]--&gt;D[3]--&gt;E[4]--&gt;F[5]\n   G[6]--&gt;H[7]--&gt;I[8]--&gt;J[9]--&gt;A[10]\n   subgraph workdays[work days]\n   B\n   C\n   G\n   H\n   D\n   I\n   end\n   subgraph restdays[rest days]\n   A\n   F\n   E\n   J\n   workdays\n   end\n   style restdays color:transparent;\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth flowcharts use dod numbers, but the bottom one starts from Dod 1 instead of Dod 0 and refers to Dod 0 as Dod 10. Like the dods in the flowcharts above⬆️, the doys in the tables below⬇️are arranged in both a zero-based (top) and a one-based (bottom) manner. The tables visualize the seamless transition between a common year and the subsequent year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRest\nWork\nWork\nWork\nRest\n\n\n\n\n360\n361\n362\n363\n364\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork\nWork\nWork\nRest\nRest\n\n\n\n\n361\n362\n363\n364\n0\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\n\nAfter 4 or 8 years of consecutive pents, the Schedule 3 pattern shown in the flowcharts and tables above⬆️is interrupted by 3 consecutive rest days during the transition from a leap year. This interruption is represented by 4 empty cells in the middle row of the two tables below⬇️. The middle row contains only one day: Day 365 in the top table and Day 0 in bottom one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRest\nWork\nWork\nWork\nRest\n\n\n\n\n360\n361\n362\n363\n364\n\n\n\n\n\n\n365\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork\nWork\nWork\nRest\nRest\n\n\n\n\n361\n362\n363\n364\n365\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\n\nThe last pentaday (pent) in common years is Pent 72. Day 365 is the only day in Pent 73. Day 0 is the first day of Pent 0, the first pent of the year. To get the current pent number, , we double the current dek number, , and then add 1 if the current dod number, , is greater than 4. To avoid off-by-one errors, pent, dek, dod, and dow numbers are always zero-based in Dec.\nOther than pent numbers, a pent can also be expressed as a span🌈. Pent 72 can be represented as 360=365-5, 360=-5, or 360=365. In addition to omitting the subtrahend or the difference, we can make the subtrahend precede the minuend to indicate that we want to start from the latest day and work backwards: 365=360+5, 365=360, or 365=+5.\nSpans🌈can also represent groups of non-consecutive days. All of the Schedule 3 work days in a year can be expressed as 1=4=:5. In this span🌈, we start with Days 1, 2, and 3 and then include every day that is a multiple of 5 days away from one of the starting days. The number preceded by a colon is called a step and determines which days we want to include.\n\n\n\n\n\nWikimedia\n\n\nSchedule 3 is one of six dekly schedules that allow us to organize work and rest days into five homogeneous columns like in the tables and flowcharts above⬆️. These schedules are like the gears⚙️of a 5-speed manual transmission in a car. The approximate speed ranges for the five gears⚙️are &lt;5, 5 to 10, 10 to 15, 15 to 20, and ≥20 kilometers per centiday.\nIn this analogy, Neutral (N), 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th gear⚙️are Schedules 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. To complete the gearshift analogy, Reverse (R) would be a time machine that takes us to the past. As our driving speed changes, we would shift up to a higher gear⚙️or shift down to a lower gear⚙️. Similarly, we can switch between the six dekly schedules as needed.\nThe names of the dekly schedules are derived from their respective numbers of work days per pent. The total🧮number of work days per year provided by Schedules 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are 0, 73, 146, 219, 292, and 365, respectively. In general, Schedule 3 should be the default and Schedule 5 should only be used temporarily during crises‼️and emergencies🚨.\nIn addition to switching between schedules, we can also mix them to create hybrid schedules. Schedule 34 mixes Schedules 3 and 4 to obtain an annual total🧮of 255 work days without modifying the transition between years shown in the tables above⬆️. This annual total🧮is about 1 pent less than the 260 to 262 work days that we get annually from a five-day workweek.\nUnlike weekly schedules, Schedules 3 and 34 provide a consistent🎯number of work days every year. While Days 364, 365, and 0 can be work or rest days in the Gregorian calendar🗓️, these days are always rest days if we follow Schedules 3 or 34. Therefore, Schedules 3 and 34 do not require any holidays to smooth the transition between years.\nThere are 11 United States Federal holidays. Federal holidays that fall on a Gregorian calendar🗓️rest day, Dow 0 or Dow 6, are observed on the nearest Gregorian calendar🗓️work day: Dow 1 or Dow 5. To apply this rule to Schedule 3, we would observe the Day 110⛓️‍💥, 125🎆, 255🫡, and 299🎄holidays on Days 111⛓️‍💥, 126🎆, 256🫡, and 298🎄, respectively.\nWith dekly schedules, we can determine whether any date falls on a work or a rest day with just a glance. Counterintuitively, dekly schedules can be based on months instead of deks. Month-based dekly schedules distinguish between work and rest days based on the last digit of doms. The drawback of month-based schedules is that doms reset twelve times every year.\nThe month-based Schedules 3 and 34 have 223 and 258 work days per year, respectively, but will require at least one holiday to avoid six consecutive work days during the transition from a Dec common year. The best time to switch from a weekly to a dekly schedule may be from Day 31 to 93 when the original and month-based versions of Schedules 3 and 34 are identical.\n\n\nDay of month (dom)\nDec dates can be expanded to display Dec month and POSIX dom numbers. The current Dec dom date is ++. Dec month numbers are the last doy of the previous month because POSIX doms are one-based. For zero-based doms, Dec represents each month with its first doy: ++. This way, Dec can support both zero- and one-based doms.\nDec dom dates replace the doy d from Dec dates with d-m+m. We evaluate the subtraction to get d-m, the Dec month number, but not the addition, so we can see m, the dom. If we combine the dom and dow patterns above⬆️, we can create hybrid dom+dow Dec dates: +++, where  is d-m-w, the doy of the last Dow 0 before the beginning of the month.\nWe can obtain Dec month numbers using only a pair of hands🤲by counting index☝️and ring💍fingers as 30 days and other fingers as 31 days. For zero-based doms, we start counting from 0. For one-based doms, we start counting from -1, as shown in the image below⬇️. To spread 12 months across 10 fingers, the first and last fingers each represent 2 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n    \n        \n            \n            \n        \n        \n

September183October213November244December274January305February336\n\nWikimedia\nThe finger🖐mnemonic described above⬆️is similar to the knuckle👊and musical keyboard🎹mnemonics. These mnemonics attempt to make sense of the irregular pattern of month lengths in the Gregorian calendar🗓️. As opposed to months, we do not need mnemonics, tables, or mental calculations to use deks, because all of the required information is plainly visible in the doy.\n\n\nMonth of year (moy)\nTo convert doys to or from POSIX month and dom numbers, we can use the month of year (moy) equations from the civil_from_days and days_from_civil algorithms. Unlike POSIX month numbers, moys are zero-based and start from Moy 0 instead of Moy 10. As shown in the first moy equation below⬇️, we can obtain a moy from a doy or a POSIX month number.\n\n\\[\\text{moy} = (5 \\times \\text{doy} + 2) \\div 153 = \\begin{cases}\\text{month}-3&{\\text{if }\\text{month}\\gt 2;}\\\\\\text{month}+9&{\\text{otherwise.}}\\end{cases}\\]\n\n\\[\\text{month} = \\begin{cases}\\text{moy}+3&{\\text{if }\\text{moy}\\lt 10;}\\\\\\text{moy}-9&{\\text{otherwise.}}\\end{cases}\\]\n\\[\\text{dom} = \\text{doy} - (153 \\times \\text{moy} + 2) \\div 5 + 1\\]\n\\[\\text{doy} = (153 \\times \\text{moy}+ 2) \\div 5 + \\text{dom} - 1\\]\nA moy and its equivalent POSIX month number differ by 9 in Moy 10 or 11 and -3 in any other moy because the Dec epoch, 0000+000, is 2 months later than the Gregorian calendar🗓️epoch: -0001+306. To convert years, we add 1 to Dec years and subtract 1 from Gregorian calendar🗓️years if the doy is greater than 305, the moy is greater than 9, or the month is less than 3:\n\n\\[\\text{Dec year} = \\begin{cases}\\text{Gregorian calendar year}-1&{\\text{if }\\text{doy}\\gt 305\\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction}{\\lor}\\text{moy}\\gt 9\\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction}{\\lor}\\text{month}\\lt 3;}\\\\\\text{Gregorian calendar year}&{\\text{otherwise.}}\\end{cases}\\]\n\n\n\\[\\text{Gregorian calendar year} = \\begin{cases}\\text{Dec year}+1&{\\text{if }\\text{doy}\\gt 305\\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction}{\\lor}\\text{moy}\\gt 9\\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction}{\\lor}\\text{month}\\lt 3;}\\\\\\text{Dec year}&{\\text{otherwise.}}\\end{cases}\\]\n\n\n\nSummary\nThis article describes Dec and how it can interoperate with the Gregorian calendar🗓️by minuend expanding Dec dates into dom and dow dates or dividend expanding dow dates into woy dates. On its own, Dec minuend expands dates into span🌈equivalents, but has no use for dividend expansion, because doys display deks and dods without any expansion.\nThe flowchart below⬇️visualizes the conversion of the UNIX epoch Dec date 1969+306 into a Gregorian calendar🗓️year, month, dom and dow. To obtain its associated dow, we first need to convert a Dec date into a doe. Outside of its interoperability with the Gregorian calendar🗓️, Dec converts dates into does to find the number of days in between two dates.\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'default', 'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '20px'}}}%%\nflowchart LR\n   L~~~Y\n   L--&gt;Y\n   L--&gt;D\n   L--&gt;E\n   R--&gt;Y\n   M--&gt;R[  ]:::empty\n   D--&gt;A\n   D~~~B[  ]:::empty\n   A--&gt;G\n   G--&gt;R\n   Y~~~L[  ]:::empty\n   Y---A[  ]:::empty\n   Y~~~A\n   B--&gt;M\n   B~~~N\n   B--&gt;N\n   B--&gt;D\n   B~~~D\n   N~~~B\n   E--&gt;W\n   subgraph decdate[Decalendar]\n   Y[yoe&lt;br&gt;1969]\n   D[doy&lt;br&gt;306]\n   E[doe&lt;br&gt;719468]\n   end\n   subgraph gregdate[Gregorian calendar]\n   W[dow&lt;br&gt;4]\n   G[year&lt;br&gt;1970]\n   M[month&lt;br&gt;1]\n   N[dom&lt;br&gt;1]\n   end\n   classDef empty width:0px;\n   click E \"#doe\"\n   click W \"#dow\"\n   click Y \"#yoe\"\n   click D \"#doy\"\n   click G \"#eya\"\n   click M \"#moy\"\n   click N \"#dom\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor simplicity, the flowchart above⬆️does not show conversion byproducts, such as the coe, yoc, and doc generated during Dec doe to date conversion or the moy that we need in order to split a doy into a month and a dom or combine a month and a dom into a doy. The arrows in the flowchart represent equations adapted from chrono-Compatible Low-Level Date Algorithms.\nInstead of converting Dec dates, we can expand them to view the information we need as part of the math-inspired notation of Dec. At its heart❤️, Dec is a simple system that uses only years and days for time measurement. Thanks to Dec expansion, Dec can work with other units. In this way, Dec expansion bridges the gap between the Dec and Gregorian calendars🗓️.\n\n\nNext\nAfter reading this article, you should be able to understand the examples in my filter, include, and script articles, but you may want to start with my Quarto article. To see the full extent of the benefits that Dec provides, I recommend that you continue through the Dec section of my site to the time⏳, snap🫰, and span🌈articles.

A date year+day and a time .clock-z can be combined into a snap🫰year+day.clock-z. Like the yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss+hh:mm format of the ISO🌐8601 international date📅and time⏳standard, Dec snaps🫰represent a point in time and organize their components from the largest to the smallest.\nIn between the year and zone of a Dec snap🫰is day.clock, a single number called a day-of-year (doy) which serves the same purpose as the month, day-of-month (dom), hour, minute, and second in between the year and time zone in the ISO🌐format. The integer part of the doy, day, identifies a specific day in the given year and its fractional part is the time-of-day (tod): .clock.\nThe Dec snap🫰in the Zone 0 Dec time⏳zone, +.+0, is equivalent to its ISO🌐8601 counterpart in the UTC+00:00 time⏳zone: --T::+00:00. In the current doy, ., the integer part, , corresponds to the ISO🌐month and dom, -, and the fractional part, ., converts to the ISO🌐hour, minute, and second: T::.\n\nviewof schedule = Inputs.radio([2, 3, 4, 5], {label: \"Workdays per pent\", value: 3})\nviewof intervals = Inputs.form([\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [.3, .7], label: '0 or 5', width: 195, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}=${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [.3, .7], label: '1 or 6', width: 195, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}=${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [.3, .7], label: '2 or 7', width: 195, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}=${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [0, 0], label: '3 or 8', width: 195, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}=${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [0, 0], label: '4 or 9', width: 195, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}=${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n])\npentBar = Plot.plot({\n  x: {label: \"Day of the dek\", labelOffset: 36, labelArrow: true, labelAnchor: \"center\"},\n  style: {fontSize: \"16px\"},\n  marginBottom: 40,\n  marginLeft: 45,\n  width: width,\n  className: \"pentbar\",\n  color: {scheme: \"Set1\", legend: \"swatches\", reverse: true, className: \"pentbarlegend\"},\n  y: {label: \"Proportion of the day\", domain: [1, 0], tickPadding: 6, tickSize: -4, labelOffset: 44, labelArrow: true, labelAnchor: \"center\"},\n  marks: [\n  Plot.barY(durations, {x: \"label\", y: \"duration\", fill: \"group\"}),\n  Plot.textY(\n      durations,\n      Plot.stackY(\n        Plot.groupX(\n          { y: \"first\", text: \"first\",\n          },\n          {\n            x: \"label\",\n            z: \"group\",\n            y: \"duration\",\n            text: (d) =&gt; (d.duration &lt; .0001 ? null : formatDecimal(d.duration)),\n            fill: \"white\",\n            stroke: \"black\",\n            fontSize: 28,\n          }\n        )\n      )\n    ),\n  ]})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'default', 'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '32px'}}}%%\nflowchart LR\n   A[Dec]--&gt;B[date]--&gt;C[time]--&gt;D[snap]--&gt;E[span]\n   click A \"/dec\"\n   click B \"/dec/date\"\n   click C \"/dec/time\"\n   click D \"/dec/snap\"\n   click E \"/dec/span\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction unix2dote(unix, zone, offset = 719468) {\n  return [(unix ??

The top, middle, and bottom bars📊indicate the decidays, millidays, and centimillidays, respectively, of the time since the start, +, or until the end, -, of the day in the Dec time zone, , at the location of the red⭕️circle on the map🗺️beneath the bars📊.\nTo rotate the globe🌐in the Earth🌏orbit diagram, drag the red⭕️circle horizontally↔︎️or slide the red🔴dot on the daylight area chart vertically↕. The red⭕️circle’s vertical↕position determines the yearly daylight pattern visualized by the area chart. Shift the red—line on the area chart horizontally↔︎️to move the globe🌐along the ellipse of the Earth🌎orbit.\n\nviewof bordertoggle = labelToggle(Inputs.toggle, \"Border\", false, \"bordertoggle\")\nviewof gridtoggle = labelToggle(Inputs.toggle, \"Grid\", false, \"gridtoggle\")\nviewof utctoggle = labelToggle(Inputs.toggle, \"UTC\", false, \"utctoggle\")\nviewof suntoggle = labelToggle(Inputs.toggle, \"Sun\", false, \"suntoggle\")\nrstbtn.node();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar chart clocks\n\nbarChart = {\n  const W = 800;\n  const H = 88;\n  const barX = 1;\n  const firstBarY = 1;\n  const svg = d3\n    .create(\"svg\")\n    .attr(\"width\", W)\n    .attr(\"viewBox\", [0, 0, W / 1.14, H]);\n  const xRange = [0, W - 100];\n  const scaleDD = d3.scaleLinear()\n    .domain([0, 10])\n    .range(xRange);\n  const scaleMandB = d3.scaleLinear()\n    .domain([0, 100])\n    .range(xRange);\n  // Background bars to show where 100% lies\n  svg.selectAll('.background')\n    .data([\n      'dd', \"mils\", 'beats'])\n    .enter()\n    .append('rect')\n    .attr('class', 'background timeBar')\n    .attr('width', W-100)\n    .attr('y', (d,i)=&gt;i*30+firstBarY)\n  // Beats\n  svg\n    .append('rect')\n    .attr('class', 'timeBar')\n    .attr('y', firstBarY+60)\n    .attr('width', d =&gt; scaleMandB(Number(barBeats)))\n  svg\n    .append('rect')\n    .attr('class', 'timeBarFull')\n    .attr('y', firstBarY+60)\n    .attr('width', d =&gt; scaleMandB(barBeats))\n  // Cents/Mils\n  svg\n    .append('rect')\n    .attr('class', 'timeBar')\n    .attr('y', firstBarY)\n    .attr('width', d =&gt; scaleDD(Number(barDD)+Number(barMils)/100+Number(barBeats)/10000))\n  svg\n    .append('rect')\n    .attr('class', 'timeBarFull')\n    .attr('y', firstBarY)\n    .attr('width', d =&gt; scaleDD(barDD))\n  svg\n    .append('rect')\n    .attr('class', 'timeBar')\n    .attr('y', firstBarY+30)\n    .attr('width', d =&gt; scaleMandB(Number(barMils)+Number(barBeats)/100))\n  svg\n    .append('rect')\n    .attr('class', 'timeBarFull')\n    .attr('y', firstBarY+30)\n    .attr('width', d =&gt; scaleMandB(barMils))\n  // Cent ticks\n  svg.selectAll('.tickC')\n    .data(d3.range(width &gt; 500 ?

A doy identifies a day in a year like a Gregorian calendar month and “day of month” (dom). A tod specifies a point in a day like an “hour minute second” (hms) triplet. Together, a doy and tod can form a “annual day aggregate” (ada): .\n\\[\\begin{split}\n\\text{ada\\;\\,} & = \\text{doy} + \\text{tod} \\\\\n\\lfloor\\text{ada}\\rfloor & = \\text{doy} \\\\\n\\end{split}\\]\nAs their names suggest, doys and adas are measured in days. The measurement unit of a tod can be a day or a submultiple of a day. By changing how a decimal tod is measured, we can shift its decimal separator or turn it into an integer. The tods along the y-axis of the area chart are integers because they have three digits and are measured in millidays.\nEpochal day aggregate (eda)\nTo obtain a tod from a ada, we can keep the remainder after dividing by one to isolate the decimal part of the quotient:  mod 1 = . We can use this same approach to separate a tod from an “epochal day aggregate” (eda):  mod 1 = . The current eda tells us how many days have passed since the Dec epoch.\n\\[\\begin{split}\n\\text{tod} &= \\text{ada mod } 1 &&= \\text{eda mod } 1 \\\\\n\\text{tod} &= \\text{ada} - \\text{doy} &&= \\text{eda} - \\lfloor\\text{eda}\\rfloor\n\\end{split}\\]\nThe Dec doe equations We can describe an “epochal year aggregate” (eya) instead of a yoe,\nWhen provided with an “epochal day aggregate” (eda) instead of a doe, the Dec date equations return a “annual day aggregate” (ada) instead of a doy. While does and doys are integers, edas and adas each have a decimal part called a “time of day” (tod). We can obtain an eda by passing a yoe and ada to the Dec eda equations or by summing a doe and a tod. isolate a tod from an eda or ada, and convert between a doe and eda or a doy and ada.\n\n\\[\\text{eda} = \\text{coe}\\times146097 + \\text{yoc}\\times365 + \\lfloor\\frac{\\text{yoc}}{4}\\rfloor - \\lfloor\\frac{\\text{yoc}}{100}\\rfloor + \\text{ada}\\]\n\n\\[\\text{tod} = \\text{eda mod } 1 = \\text{ada mod } 1\\]\n\\[\\text{doe} = \\lfloor \\text{eda} \\rfloor = \\text{eda} - \\text{tod}\\]\n\\[\\text{doy} = \\lfloor \\text{ada} \\rfloor = \\text{ada} - \\text{tod}\\]\n\\[\\text{eda} = \\text{doe} + \\text{tod}\\]\n\\[\\text{ada} = \\text{doy} + \\text{tod}\\]\nUNIX time equation\nSimilarly, UNIX time tallies the seconds since the UNIX epoch, which is exactly 719468 days after the Dec epoch. To get the tod in Zone 0, the Dec time zone that is in between the two leftmost vertical lines on the map🗺️, we can divide UNIX time by the number of seconds in a day and then keep the remainder after dividing the resulting days by one:\n\\[\\text{tod} = \\text{unix} \\div 86400 \\text{ mod } 1\\]\nJulian time equation\nJulian dates track the days since the beginning of the Julian period and thus are akin to edas. We can produce a Zone 5 tod from a Julian date simply by keeping the remainder after dividing by one. If we want a Zone 0 tod instead, we should add 5 decidays to the Julian date before converting it to a tod to ensure that the final result is less than one day:\n\\[\\text{tod} = (\\text{julian} + 0.5) \\text{ mod } 1\\]\nHour minute second\nWe can also obtain a Zone 0 tod from a Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) hms triplet by summing its components after converting them to fractional days, as shown in the equation below.

The goal of leap seconds is to keep UTC within 25/24 centimillidays (cmds) of Universal Time (UT).\nInstead of leap seconds, Dec matches UT using a “universal time offset” (uto). With the leap second insertion dates provided by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, we can approximate the uto that yields UT when added to the Zone 0 tod on the Dec date chosen by the range🎚️inputs below:  ÷ 8640 = .\n\nviewof leapSecondYear = Inputs.range([1970, 2020], {label: \"Year\", value: 1995, step: 1})\nviewof leapSecondDate = Inputs.range([0, 365], {label: \"Day\", value: 182, step: 1})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRounded offset decimal\nOf the twenty eight utos that can be shown in the equation above, one is an integer, one is a terminating decimal, and the rest are repeating decimals. To express a repeating decimal uto, Dec uses an irreducible fraction that is called an “exact offset fraction” (eof) when by itself or a “rounding error fraction” (ref) if it follows a “rounded offset decimal” (rod).\nIn the equation below, the uto is the minuend, the rod is the subtrahend, and the ref is the difference. Dec uses the term minuend expansion to describe the replacement of a minuend with a subtrahend and a difference. By replacing a repeating decimal uto with a rod and a ref, we can show the initial digits of the uto as a decimal and the rest as a fraction.\n\\[\\text{uto} - \\text{rod} = \\text{ref}\\]\nUse the first three range🎚️inputs below to select an hms triplet to be converted to decidays, plugged into the equation above as the uto, rounded to the number of digits chosen by the fourth range🎚️input, and inserted into the equation as the rod. Once the left-hand side of the equation is complete, we can solve it to get the ref:  –  = .\n\nviewof hmsinput = Inputs.form([\n  Inputs.range([0, 23], {label: \"Hour\", value: 11, step: 1}),\n  Inputs.range([0, 59], {label: \"Minute\", value: 0, step: 1}),\n  Inputs.range([0, 59], {label: \"Second\", value: 0, step: 1}),\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof digits = Inputs.range([1, 9], {label: \"Digits\", value: 3, step: 1})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime zone offset\nIn Dec, a uto can be any type of number, a “time zone offset” (tzo) is an integer, a “solar time offset” (sto) is a terminating decimal, and an eof is a repeating decimal. If we derived deciday offsets from all 86400 of the hms triplets that can be selected by the range🎚️inputs above, we would have 10 tzos, 3190 stos, and 83200 eofs or rod and ref pairs.\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC)\nWhen we do the same to the 38 UTC offsets, we get only eofs or rod and ref pairs unless the number of leaps seconds included is zero or a multiple of 27. If the leap second count is zero or a multiple of 8640, we will get 3 tzos, 9 stos, and 26 eofs or rod and ref pairs. The 3 tzos will be stos if the number of leap seconds is a multiple of 27 but not 8640.\nThere are 14 negative and 24 positive UTC offsets. The UTC time zone with the most negative offset is completely uninhabited. The bar📊chart below visualizes Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center data from 2020 regarding the population of each UTC time zone. The vast majority of all people live in UTC time zones with positive offsets.\n\n// https://observablehq.com/@mattdzugan/population-by-time-zone-creating-a-dataset\nviewof sortParams = Inputs.form([\n  Inputs.toggle({ label: \"Sort ascending\" }),\n  Inputs.toggle({ label: \"Sort by offset\" }),\n  ])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// https://observablehq.com/@mattdzugan/population-by-time-zone-creating-a-dataset\nPlot.plot({\n  width: Math.min(width, 1000),\n  height: 100 + Math.min(width / 25, 20),\n  marginBottom: 50,\n  style: `overflow: visible;font-size:${15 + Math.min(width / 90, 11)}px;`,\n  color: {scheme: \"RdBu\", className: \"barPlotLegend\"},\n  marginLeft: 80 + Math.min(width / 100, 20),\n  y: { label: null },\n  x: { grid: true, label: \"Population (billions)\", labelOffset: 45 + Math.min(width / 90, 22), transform: d =&gt; d / 1e9 },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.barX(sortedPop, {x: \"pop\", y: \"Sign\", fill: \"Offset\", stroke: \"black\", tip: true }),\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative UTC offsets only exist in the Americas and islands in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Therefore, the bar📊chart above is essentially comparing the Americas to the rest of the world. According to 2021 United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs data, about one billion out of a total of almost eight billion people live in the Americas.\nWhenever a negative offset is associated with a Dec date, a tod, or both a date and a tod, Dec will add one day to the date and ten decidays to the offset without modifying the tod. This typically occurs after the conversion of an hms triplet to a tod or a “year month day” (ymd) triplet to a Dec date. As a result, all Dec dates and tods have positive offsets.\nDec will not change a negative offset or its associated doy if the result of adding one day to the doy is uncertain. This uncertainly can only exist if we do not know whether a doy that is equal to 364 belongs to a common or leap year. The day after Day 364 of a common year is Day 0 of the subsequent year. In a leap year, Day 364 precedes Day 365.\nDay of week\nEven though it has no effect on the tod, adding one day to the doy also increments the “day of month” (dom) and “day of week” (dow) shown by Dec. The table below shows how someone accustomed to a negative offset could intrepret Dec dow numbers. From the perspective of a negative offset user, the dom and dow in Dec will be one day ahead.\n\n\n\nSaturday\nSunday\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\n\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n\n\n\n\nThe one day difference between positive and negative offsets may make Dec dow numbers more intuitive than POSIX dow numbers for people who consider Sunday to be the first dow. According to the Common Locale Data Repository and a 2023 population ranking, over 89% of people in the Americas live in a country that starts the week on Sunday.\nLongitude and offsets\nIn Dec, offsets are closely related to longitude. Dec measures longitude in parallels (λ) or submultiples of λ like deciparallels (dλ). A tzo is essentially a dλ longitude that had its decimal part removed via rounding, flooring, truncation, or ceiling. Whereas tzos have one digit, deciday tods and stos typically have up to four digits after the decimal separator.\nThe fourth digit in the decimal part of any current deciday tod increments 105 times per day, 100 times per milliday, or once per beat (iob), which is the lower bound of the normal resting heart rate of an adult. For everyday life, we should limit the length of tods to the three digits needed to show millidays (md) or the five digits required to display beats (b).\nWhen the current tod has seven digits, the sixth digit changes too quickly to be read out loud and the seventh changes so fast that it appears as a blur. Near the Equator, a longitude that has seven digits is accurate to within about ten zems (z) or four meters, which is roughly the length of a subcompact car or the width of a U-shaped living room layout.\nThe Equator is approximately (~) 103 millitaurs (mc), ~4 × 104 kilometers (km), or ~105 kilozems (kz) long. If we move 1 mc, 40 km, or 100 kz to the East or West on or near the Equator, our sto will change by ~1 md, ~1.44 minutes, or ~100 b and our longitude will shift by ~0.36 degrees, ~1 milliparallel (mλ), ~21.6 arcminutes, or ~100 arcbeats (ab).\nFor precise geopositioning, it may be helpful to show geographic coordinates in submultiples of ab, but we are unlikely to benefit from units smaller than md when displaying the solar time or estimates of what the tod will be when the Sun rises, reaches its zenith, or sets on a given day. By default, Dec uses three digits to show each solar time and sto.\nEquation of time\nThe two types of solar time are “mean solar time” (mst) and “apparent solar time” (ast). To calculate mst, we keep only the decimal part of the sum of 0.95, the Zone 0 tod measured in days, and our longitude measured in λ. If we want ast instead of mst, the sum needs to include the result of plugging the “time of year” (toy) into the “equation of time” (eot).\n\\[\\text{toy} = \\text{ada} \\div \\text{n}\\]\n\\[\\text{mst} = (0.95 + \\text{tod} + \\lambda) \\text{ mod } 1\\]\n\\[\\text{ast} = (0.95 + \\text{tod} + \\lambda +  \\text{eot(toy)}) \\text{ mod } 1\\]\nTo obtain the toy, we divide the ada by the number of days in the year (n). If we use trigonometric functions that are designed to work with radians, we will have to multiply the toy by \\(2\\pi\\) or \\(\\tau\\). We do not need to modify the toy before passing it to the eot() function defined below because its trigonometric functions expect turns instead of radians.\n\\[\\begin{split}\n\\text{eot(toy)} & = \\beta_0 \\\\\n& + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{costau(toy)} \\\\\n& + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{costau(2} \\times \\text{toy)} \\\\\n& + \\beta_3 \\times \\text{sintau(toy)} \\\\\n& + \\beta_4 \\times \\text{sintau(2} \\times \\text{toy)}\n\\end{split}\\]\n\n\nJulia\nObservable JavaScript\nPython\nR\n\n\n\n\nsincostau(x) = sincospi(2 * x)\n\nsincostau (generic function with 1 method)\n\nsincostau(0.25)\n\n(1.0, 0.0)\n\nsincostau(0.5)\n\n(0.0, -1.0)\n\nsincos(0.25 * 2 * pi)\n\n(1.0, 6.123233995736766e-17)\n\nsincos(0.5 * 2 * pi)\n\n(1.2246467991473532e-16, -1.0)\n\n\n\n\n\nsincospi = require(\n  'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-sincospi@umd/browser.js'\n  )\nfunction sincostau(x) {\n  return sincospi(2 * x);\n}\nfunction sincos(x) {\n  x *= 2 * Math.PI\n  return [Math.sin(x), Math.cos(x)]\n}\nsincostau(0.25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsincostau(0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsincos(0.25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsincos(0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom math import cos, sin, pi\nfrom mpmath import cospi, sinpi\n\ndef sincostau(x):\n    x *= 2\n    return sinpi(x), cospi(x)\n\ndef sincos(x):\n    x *= 2 * pi\n    return sin(x), cos(x)\n\nsincostau(0.25)\n\n(mpf('1.0'), mpf('0.0'))\n\nsincostau(0.5)\n\n(mpf('0.0'), mpf('-1.0'))\n\nsincos(0.25)\n\n(1.0, 6.123233995736766e-17)\n\nsincos(0.5)\n\n(1.2246467991473532e-16, -1.0)\n\n\n\n\n\nsincostau &lt;- function(x) {\n  x &lt;- 2 * x\n  c(sinpi(x), cospi(x))\n}\n\nsincos &lt;- function(x) {\n  x &lt;- 2 * x * pi\n  c(sin(x), cos(x))\n}\n\nsincostau(0.25)\n\n[1] 1 0\n\nsincostau(0.5)\n\n[1]  0 -1\n\nsincos(0.25)\n\n[1] 1.000000e+00 6.123234e-17\n\nsincos(0.5)\n\n[1]  1.224647e-16 -1.000000e+00\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code above compares two functions which return both the sine and cosine of their input. The sincos() function assumes it will receive radians and the sincostau() works with turns. In general, working with turns is more convenient and intuitive. The examples above demonstrate that using turns instead of radians can yield more accurate results.\nThe values below are the coefficients of a model adapted from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) General Solar Position Calculations. Before fitting the model to NOAA yearly solar data, we need to convert eot(toy) values from minutes to centidays, combine ymd triplet dates and hms triplet times into adas, and sort by ada.\n\n\n\n{0: 0.0011114386869002235,\n 1: -4.155124400404918,\n 2: -2.9710873225303756,\n 3: -4.635570414590801,\n 4: 5.116176940364264}\n\n\n\n\n// https://observablehq.com/@mcmcclur/plot-for-mathematicians\n{\n  let w = 800;\n  let h = 0.625 * w;\n  let samples = build_samples(\n    getEot, -366, 365, { N: 150 }\n  );\n  let plot = Plot.plot({\n    marginLeft: 60,\n    width: w,\n    height: h,\n    style: \"font-size:19;\",\n    y: {label: \"milliday eot(toy)\"},\n    x: {label: \"day of year\"},\n    marks: [\n      Plot.line(samples, {\n        strokeWidth: 4,\n        stroke: \"steelblue\",\n        tip: true\n      }),\n      Plot.ruleX([-366]),\n      Plot.ruleY([0]),\n      Plot.axisX({ y: 0 }),\n      Plot.axisY({ x: -366 })\n    ]\n  });\n  return plot;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line📈chart above uses md to display eot(toy) values as integers. There is little difference between mst and ast around Days 45, 103, 184, and 299. The difference ranges from about -9.8 on Day 244 to around 11.4 md on Day 350. We can calculate mst with just a tod and a longitude and we will be off by at most about a centiday compared to ast.\nApart from turning a mst into an ast, we can also use eot to more accurately estimate the tods of solar noon, sunrise, and sunset. The equation below creates a solar noon tod measured in days by adding 9.55 to a longitude measured in λ, subtracting a tzo and a eot(toy) value that are both measured in days, and keeping only the decimal part of the result.\n\\[\\text{solarnoon} = (9.55 + \\text{tzo} - \\lambda - \\text{eot(toy)) mod 1}\\]\nCambridge and Cambridge\nTo compare the solar noon tod in two cities, we can plug in the longitude of each city into the equation above. If all the variables in the equation other than longitude are set to zero, the result is almost five decidays for Cambridge, England in the United Kingdom and nearly seven decidays for Cambridge, Massachusetts in the United States.\n\\[4.99635 = (9.55 - 0.050365) \\text{ mod 1} \\times 10\\]\n\\[6.97516 = (9.55 - 0.852484) \\text{ mod 1} \\times 10\\]\nThe two homonymous cities are about two dλ apart and thus will always differ by around two decidays in solar time, regardless of what time zone we use as our frame of reference. England is in Zone 0 and Massachusetts is in Zone 8. If we change the tzo from zero to eight decidays, the solar noon tod for each city will be two decidays earlier.\n\\[2.99635 = (9.55 + 0.8 - 0.050365) \\text{ mod 1} \\times 10\\]\n\\[4.97516 = (9.55 + 0.8 - 0.852484) \\text{ mod 1} \\times 10\\]\nFull day arc\nThe path in the sky that the Sun appears to follow from a sunrise to a sunset is a “day arc” (da). Solar noon, the midpoint of a da, is halfway between sunrise and sunset. On each side of solar noon is a “half day arc” (da/2). The sum of a solar noon tod and a da/2 is a sunset tod and the difference between a solar noon tod and a da/2 is a sunrise tod.\n\\[\\begin{split}\n\\text{sunset} & = \\text{solarnoon} + \\frac{\\text{da}}{2} && = \\text{sunrise} + \\text{da} \\\\\n\\text{sunrise} & = \\text{solarnoon} - \\frac{\\text{da}}{2} && = \\text{sunset} - \\text{da}\n\\end{split}\\]\nFull night arc\nThe Sun continues its path after it disappears below the horizon, moving from sunset to sunrise along a “night arc” (na). Like conjugate angles, a da and a na form a full circle that represents one day. Likewise, a da/2 and a “half night arc” (na/2) are like two supplementary angles that form a semicircle from solar noon to the na midpoint: solar midnight.\n\n\\[\\text{solarmidnight} = \\text{solarnoon} + \\frac{\\text{da}}{2} + \\frac{\\text{na}}{2} = \\text{sunset} + \\frac{\\text{na}}{2}\\]\n\nThe range input below controls the yellow da and the blue na in the diagram beneath it. At the Equator, the sunrise always rises about a quarter turn from North and sets around three quarter turns from North, resulting in a da of approximately half a day: 75% – 25% = 50%. If da is zero, a polar night occurs. A day without a na is called a polar day.\n\nviewof dayArcInput = Inputs.range([0, 1000], {label: \"Day arc\", value: 375, step: 1})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\n  const svg = d3.create(\"svg\")\n      .attr(\"width\", width)\n      .attr(\"height\", daheight);\n  svg.append(\"circle\")\n      .attr(\"stroke\", window.darkmode ? \"white\" : \"black\")\n      .attr(\"fill\", \"none\")\n      .attr(\"r\", daradius)\n      .attr(\"transform\", `translate(${dacenter})`);\n  const tick = svg.selectAll(\".tick\")\n      .data([0, 45].map(n =&gt; d3.range(n, 360, 90)).flat().sort((a, b) =&gt; a - b))\n    .enter().append(\"g\")\n      .attr(\"class\", \"tick\");\n  tick.append(\"polyline\")\n      .attr(\"points\", d =&gt; [-3, 3].map(n =&gt; geometric.pointTranslate(dacenter, -d, daradius + n)))\n      .attr(\"stroke\", window.darkmode ? \"white\" : \"black\");\n  tick.append(\"text\")\n      .attr(\"dy\", d =&gt; d === 0 || d === 180 ? 4 : d &gt; 0 && d &lt; 180 ? 0 : 8)\n      .attr(\"text-anchor\", d =&gt; d &lt; 90 || d &gt; 270 ? \"start\" : d &gt; 90 && d &lt; 270 ? \"end\" : \"middle\")\n      .attr(\"transform\", d =&gt; `translate(${geometric.pointTranslate(dacenter, -d, daradius + (d === 270 ? 15 : d === 315 ? 14 : d === 225 ? 13 : 12))})`)\n      .attr(\"font-family\", \"sans-serif\")\n      .attr(\"font-size\", 16)\n      .attr(\"fill\", window.darkmode ? \"white\" : \"black\")\n      .text(d =&gt; `${(1000-((d+270)%360)/.36)%1000}`);\n  svg.append(\"polyline\")\n      .attr(\"stroke-width\", 2)\n      .attr(\"stroke\", window.darkmode ? \"violet\" : \"darkviolet\")\n      .attr(\"points\", [dacenter, [daend[0], dacenter[1]]]);\n  svg.append(\"polyline\")\n      .attr(\"stroke-width\", 2)\n      .attr(\"stroke\", window.darkmode ? \"red\" : \"darkred\")\n      .attr(\"points\", [[daend[0], dacenter[1]], daend]);\n  svg.append(\"polyline\")\n      .attr(\"stroke-width\", 2)\n      .attr(\"stroke\", window.darkmode ? \"slateblue\" : \"darkslateblue\")\n      .attr(\"points\", [[dacenter, daend]]);\n  svg.append(\"polyline\")\n      .attr(\"stroke-width\", 2)\n      .attr(\"stroke\", window.darkmode ? \"violet\" : \"darkviolet\")\n      .attr(\"points\", [dacenter, [daend1[0], dacenter[1]]]);\n  svg.append(\"polyline\")\n      .attr(\"stroke-width\", 2)\n      .attr(\"stroke\", window.darkmode ? \"red\" : \"darkred\")\n      .attr(\"points\", [[daend1[0], dacenter[1]], [daend1[0], daend1[1]]]);\n  svg.append(\"polyline\")\n      .attr(\"stroke-width\", 2)\n      .attr(\"stroke\", window.darkmode ? \"slateblue\" : \"darkslateblue\")\n      .attr(\"points\", [[dacenter, [daend1[0], daend1[1]]]]);\n  svg.append(\"path\")\n    .attr(\"transform\", `translate(${dacenter})`)\n    .attr(\"d\", d3.arc()({\n      innerRadius: 105,\n      outerRadius: 110,\n      startAngle: Math.PI - dayArcInput / 1000 * Math.PI,\n      endAngle: Math.PI + dayArcInput / 1000 * Math.PI\n    }))\n    .attr(\"stroke\", window.darkmode ? \"white\" : \"black\")\n    .attr(\"fill\", \"gold\");\n  svg.append(\"path\")\n    .attr(\"transform\", `translate(${dacenter})`)\n    .attr(\"d\", d3.arc()({\n      innerRadius: 105,\n      outerRadius: 110,\n      startAngle: Math.PI - dayArcInput / 1000 * Math.PI,\n      endAngle: dayArcInput / 1000 * Math.PI  - Math.PI\n    }))\n    .attr(\"stroke\", window.darkmode ? \"white\" : \"black\")\n    .attr(\"fill\", \"blue\");\n  return svg.node();\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe diagram above can represent both a clock and a compass. In the Northern Hemisphere, solar time is essentially the same as the “solar azimuth angle” (saa). In the Southern Hemisphere, we would need to flip the diagram upside down for it to match the saa. The bar chart below compares the populations of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\n\n// https://observablehq.com/@mattdzugan/population-by-time-zone-creating-a-dataset\nviewof sortParamsHemi = Inputs.form([\n  Inputs.toggle({ label: \"Sort ascending\" }),\n  Inputs.toggle({ label: \"Sort by offset\" }),\n  ])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot.plot({\n  width: Math.min(width, 1000),\n  height: 100 + Math.min(width / 25, 20),\n  marginBottom: 50,\n  style: `overflow: visible;font-size:${15 + Math.min(width / 90, 11)}px;`,\n  color: {scheme: \"RdBu\", className: \"barPlotLegend\"},\n  marginLeft: 90 + Math.min(width / 100, 20),\n  y: { label: null },\n  x: { grid: true, label: \"Population (billions)\", labelOffset: 40 + Math.min(width / 90, 22), transform: d =&gt; d},\n  marks: [\n    Plot.barX(sortedPopHemi, {x: \"Population\", y: \"Hemisphere\", fill: \"Offset\", stroke: \"black\", tip: true }),\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone can measure the saa during the daytime by pointing a compass at the point on the horizon below the Sun. In the Northern Hemisphere, we can use this method to approximate solar time. In the Southern Hemisphere, we can obtain solar time by measuring the saa in turns and then subtracting our measurement from one and a half turns:\n\\[\\text{solartime} \\approx \\begin{cases}\\text{saa}&{\\text{if } \\phi \\geq 0;}\\\\(1.5 - \\text{saa}) \\text{ mod } 1&{\\text{otherwise.}}\\end{cases}\\]\nThe clockwise path that the Sun follows in the Northern Hemisphere is ingrained in the Belarussian, Polish, or Ukrainian languages. These three Slavic languages each have one word for north or midnight and another word for south or noon. In Dec, zero represents both north and midnight, while both south and noon can be expressed as a half turn.\n\n\n\nTurns\nDirection\nTime\nBelarussian\nPolish\nUkrainian\n\n\n\n0\nnorth\nmidnight\nпоўнач\npółnoc\nпівніч\n\n\n0.5\nsouth\nnoon\nпоўдзень\npołudnie\nпівдень\n\n\n\n\nIf we only want to know how long the Sun will shine on a given day, we can use the top equation below to obtain a da. Alternatively, if we are interested in finding out when the Sun will rise or set on a given day, we will need to calculate a da/2 using the bottom equation below and then combine it with a solar noon tod to get a sunrise or sunset tod.\n\n\\[\\text{da} = \\frac{\\arccos\\left({\\Large\\frac{\\text{costau(0.252314)} - \\text{sintau($\\phi$)} \\times \\text{sintau(sda)}}{\\text{costau($\\phi$)} \\times \\text{costau(sda)}}}\\right)}{\\pi}\\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{\\text{da}}{2} = \\frac{\\arccos\\left({\\Large\\frac{\\text{costau(0.252314)} - \\text{sintau($\\phi$)} \\times \\text{sintau(sda)}}{\\text{costau($\\phi$)} \\times \\text{costau(sda)}}}\\right)}{\\tau}\\]\n\nSolar declination angle\nThe da and da/2 equations above require a latitude and a “solar declination angle” (sda). Dec measures latitude in turns called meridians (φ) or turn submultiples such as millimeridians (mφ). For simplicity, we can fit our eot model to sda data instead of fitting the needlessly complex sda model provided by the NOAA General Solar Position Calculations:\n\\[\\begin{split}\n\\text{sda(toy)} & = \\beta_0 \\\\\n& + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{costau(toy)} \\\\\n& + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{sintau(toy)} \\\\\n& + \\beta_3 \\times \\text{costau(2} \\times \\text{toy)} \\\\\n& + \\beta_4 \\times \\text{sintau(2} \\times \\text{toy)} \\\\\n& + \\beta_5 \\times \\text{costau(3} \\times \\text{toy)} \\\\\n& + \\beta_6 \\times \\text{sintau(3} \\times \\text{toy)} \\\\\n\\end{split}\\]\nThe top range input below picks the doy that will become the toy in our fitted sda model. The other two range inputs below chose the geographic coordinates that we need to find the sunrise and sunset tods. While the sunrise and sunset tods depend on both geographic coordinates, the da varies only by latitude and not by longitude:  –  = .\n\nviewof doyInput = Inputs.range([0, 365], {label: \"Day of year\", value: 183, step: 1})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof latInput = Inputs.range([-250, 250], {label: \"Latitude\", value: 0, step: 1})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof lonInput = Inputs.range([0, 1000], {label: \"Longitude\", value: 500, step: 1})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe equation controlled by range inputs above can be summarized as sunset – sunrise = da and can be rearranged into the sunrise equation: sunrise = sunset – da. If we plug the current tod in place of the sunrise tod in the sunrise equation without changing the sunset tod, the da will be replaced with the time until or since sunset:  =   .\nThe latest equation above is an example of a Dec span. From left to right, this span consists of a minuend, an equals sign (=), subtrahend, a plus (+) or a minus (–) sign, and a difference. A minus sign indicates the difference is the time remaining until sunset, whereas a plus sign means that the difference is the time that has passed since sunset.\nThe difference shows the remaining time as a negative number if the minuend is less than the substrahend or displays the elapsed time as a positive number if the minuend is greater than the subtrahend. In this way, the difference can act like a “T minus countdown” that becomes a “T plus countup” after an event like a rocket🚀launch.\n\\[\\begin{cases}\\text{difference}&lt;0&{\\text{if } \\text{minuend} &lt; \\text{subtrahend};}\\\\\\text{difference}=0&{\\text{if minuend} = \\text{subtrahend};}\\\\\\text{difference}&gt;0&{\\text{if minuend}&gt;\\text{subtrahend.}}\\end{cases}\\]\nWhen the minuend is the current time and the subtrahend is the timestamp of an event which occurred in the past, the difference is the time elapsed since that event. A Dec timestamp consists of a year, a day, . can be an eda, a “epochal year aggregate” (eya), or a snap🫰. Edas and eyas are the time The typical snap format is year+ada-tzo. The snap +-0 represents the b when this webpage loaded  b ago.\nEpochal year aggregate (eya)\nA doe is essentially a Dec date with a yoe that is always equal to 0 and a doy that is not restricted to 0 ≤ doy ≤ 365. Similarly, a Dec “epochal year aggregate” (eya) is basically a Dec date with a non-integer year and a day permanently set to 0. We can obtain a Dec date by passing a doe Both does and eyas allow us to represent a date as a single number and obtain the difference between two dates.\n\\[\\text{cda} = \\text{de} - \\text{coe} \\times 146097\\]\n\\[\\text{yoc} = \\biggl \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{doc} - \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{doc}}{1460} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{doc}}{36524} \\rfloor - \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{doc}}{146096} \\rfloor}{365} \\biggr \\rfloor\\]\n\\[\\text{yoe} = \\text{yoc} + \\text{coe} \\times 400\\]\n\\[\\text{doy} = \\biggl \\lfloor \\text{doc} - \\text{yoc} \\times 365 - \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{yoc}}{4} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{yoc}}{100} \\rfloor \\biggr \\rfloor\\]\nCompared to a doe, it is much easier to convert between an eya and a to turn into Dec dates. The decimal part of an eya is a called a toy. We can convert between dates to eyas with the equations below. We can obtain a yoe by flooring an eya. Likewise, we can obtain a doy by flooring the product of n and the decimal part of an eya, which is called a toy. The current eya equation values are  =  +  ÷ . We can floor an eya to get a yoe or divide its , we can obtain a\n\\[\\text{eya} = \\text{yoe} + \\text{toy} = \\text{yoe} + \\text{doy} \\div \\text{n}\\]\n\\[\\text{toy} = \\text{eya mod } 1 = \\text{doy} \\div \\text{n}\\]\n\\[\\text{doy} = \\lfloor\\text{toy}\\times\\text{n}\\rfloor\\]\n\\[\\text{eya} = \\text{yoe} + \\text{doy} \\times \\text{n}\\]\n\\[\\text{eya} = \\text{yoe} + \\text{coe} \\times 400\\]\neya = yoe + doy ÷ n.\nWe can omit the year from a snap if we replace the ada with a subtrahend and a difference or just a difference. If needed, we can obtain a snap from a difference using the equations below. First, we subtract the difference from the current eda to obtain the “eda difference difference” (edd). Then, we use the edd to get the “cycle of era” (coe), “day of cycle” (doc), “year of cycle” (yoc), and then finally the year and ada.\n\\[\\text{edd} = \\text{eda} - \\text{difference}\\]\n\\[\\text{coe} = \\Biggl \\lfloor \\frac{\\begin{cases}\\text{edd}&{\\text{if } \\text{edd} \\geq 0;}\\\\\\text{edd}-146096&{\\text{otherwise.}}\\end{cases}}{146097} \\Biggr \\rfloor\\]\n\\[\\text{doc} = \\text{edd} - \\text{coe} \\times 146097\\]\n\\[\\text{yoc} = \\biggl \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{doc} - \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{doc}}{1460} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{doc}}{36524} \\rfloor - \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{doc}}{146096} \\rfloor}{365} \\biggr \\rfloor\\]\n\\[\\text{year} = \\text{yoc} + \\text{coe} \\times 400\\]\n\\[\\text{ada} = \\text{doc} - \\text{yoc} \\times 365 - \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{yoc}}{4} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{\\text{yoc}}{100} \\rfloor\\]\nIn the equations above, eda is “epochal day aggregate”, coe is “cycle of era”, doc is “day of cycle”, and yoc is “year of cycle”.\nis “epochal day aggregate” (eda), If a subtrahend does not include a and a difference We do not need to include a with , because can also omit the . The current Zone 0 yoe+ada timestamp is .\nomit the yoe by passing the subtrahend, difference, and current “epochal day aggregate” (eda) to the\nWe can omit the tzo if the timestamp is based on Zone 0. The time since this webpage was loaded is current - load = diff. If needed, calculate the year by subtracting the ada and Δ from the current eda and passing the result to the equations below.\nTo make it easier to compare timestamps, we should agree to always set the tzo to zero. If we use a non-zero tzo, we should include it in between the event time and the elapsed time.\nLet’s say that you live in Zone 0 and there are four tods that are vital to your typical daily rhythm: you start work at 375 md, take a lunch break from 525 to 575 md, and finish work at 725 md. After one event passes, you can begin tracking the time until the next one and thus cycle through all four over the course of each day: current = 375 diff = 525 diff = 575 diff = 725 diff.\nTzo range input (include tzo only if not zero)\nAnother use case for minuend expansion is travel. If the current tod is the minuend and your estimated arrival time is the subtrahend, then travel time remaining will be the difference. When traveling, we can replace time with distance so that distance traveled so far is the minuend, the total distance is the subtrahend, and the distance remaining is the difference. Apart from travel, measuring distance in addition to time can be useful for tracking exercise such as running, bicycling, or swimming.\nTo measure distances, Dec uses taurs (c) or zems (z), with or without metric prefixes, depending on the order of magnitude of the distance being measured. One c is close to the circumference of the earth and is equal to 105 kilozem (kz) or 4 &times 105 kilometers (km). The distance between the Earth and the Moon ranges from 9.065 to 10.135 c. For larger distances, we can use astronomical units (au), light years (ly), or multiples of c such as kilotaurs (kc) and gigataurs (gc).\nau = 3740 c = 3.74 kc ly ‎ =  236525000 c = 236525 kc = 2.36525 gc\nSpeed is distance over time. Dec measures speed in omegar (v). The speed of the rotation of the Earth is close to one v and is equal to one c per day or one kz per b. The average speed of the orbit of the Moon around the Earth is about 2.2 v and the mean speed of the Earth orbit around the Sun is approximately 64 v. For higher speeds, we can use percent (%) or permille (‰) light speed (ls) and multiples of v like kv.\n%ls ‎ =  10‰ls ‎ =  647552 v = 647.552 kv\nFor distances that we can measure on Earth, we may want to use submultiples of c such as mc or nc. One mc is 100 kz or 40 km and one nc is 1 decizem (dz) or 4 centimeters (cm). Similarly, we can use submultiples of v for speeds on Earth. One milliomegar (mv) is one mc per day, one kz per centiday (cd), or one z per b and is very close to one mile per hour. An airplane flying at an average speed of 500 mv will travel the 12500 kz from Cambridge MA to Cambridge UK in a quarter day: 12500 kz / 500 mv = 25 cd.\nAround the world in 80 days is a book published by Jules Verne in 1872. The average speed of a trip around the circumference of the earth in 80 days would be about 1 / 80 v or 12.5 mv, which is a typical speed for a bicycle. If we flew in a “pedal powered airship” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship#:~:text=pedal%20powered%20airship) from Cambridge MA to Cambridge UK at an average speed of 12.5 mv, we could complete the journey in ten days: 12500 kz / 12.5 mv = 1000 cd.\nAt sunrise, the da is the amount of time until sunset. At solar noon, the time remaining before sunset will be da/2. Throughout the day, the current tod is equal to the sum of sunset tod and the difference between the current and sunset tods:  –  = .\nLike a countdown sequence, we can keep track of the time relative to sunset throughout the day. Instead of the current tod, we can display the , the and the current tod is equal to the difference between the sunset tod and the da and the current tod is equal to the difference between the sunset tod and the da/2. The Given a sunset tod of We can replace the current tod with an expression that provides the time relative to a given tod.\ncan keep track of the remaining time until sunset by minuend The tod of sunrise is found by subtracting half the da from solar noon tod. The tod of sunset is found by adding half the da to solar noon tod.\nSunrise and sunset\nSolar hour angle\nTo find the UTC tzo of a given longitude and latitude, we could use an application programming interface (API) or a database. If we only have longitude, we need to first round degrees to zero or the nearest multiple of fifteen for whole hour tzos, 7.5 for half hour tzos, or 3.75 for quarter hour tzos and then divide by fifteen to convert degrees to hours.\nNext\nThe next article in the Dec section of my site shows how we can combine Dec dates and times into Dec snaps🫰, which are analogous to the combined date and time representations in the ISO 8601 international standard for dates and times. The final article in the Dec section demonstrates how Dec dates, times, and snaps🫰can be paired up to express time intervals called Dec spans🌈.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme': 'default', 'themeVariables': { 'fontSize': '32px'}}}%%\nflowchart LR\n   A[Dec]--&gt;B[date]--&gt;C[time]--&gt;D[snap]--&gt;E[span]\n   click A \"/dec\"\n   click B \"/dec/date\"\n   click C \"/dec/time\"\n   click D \"/dec/snap\"\n   click E \"/dec/span\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCite\nPlease spread the good word about Dec using the citation information at the bottom of this article.

    "text": "Day 184 in the Gregorian Decalendar is the first day of Season 2 by meteorological reckoning and also the anniversary of the start of the World War 2. On 1939+184, World War 2 started with the German invasion of Poland. On 1939+200, sixteen days after the start of the war, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the East. Germany and the Soviet Union split Poland according to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact signed on 1939+175. The map below shows the German and Soviet invasions of Poland on Days 184 and 200, respectively, of Year 1939, as well as other military movements over the course of the subsequent 1.83 years before Germany ended the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 1941+113 with its invasion of the Soviet Union as part of Operation Barbarossa.\nOn the map, exact dates on the map are in the year+day format and approximate dates are decimal years. For more information on these date formats, take a look at date page in the Measurement section of my site. Briefly, the day in year+day counts the days since Day 0 and can be divided by the number of days in the year to obtain the fractional part of the decimal year. In the legend, there is a date range in the start:stop format, which is inspired by the slice syntax in the Python programming language.\n\n\n\nMap of military movements in Europe from 1939 to 1941\n\n\nWorld War 2 officially ended on 1945+185, 6 years and 1 day after it began, when Japan surrendered. The German surrender on 1945+068 is commemorated with Victory in Europe Day, typically on Day 68 in the West. In contrast, many countries in Russia’s sphere of influence commemorate Victory Day on Day 69. The chosen commemoration date can therefore be viewed as having political significance. On Day 69, the European Union celebrates the anniversary of the 1950 Schuman Declaration with a holiday called Europe Day. The Schuman Declaration aimed at normalizing relations and promoting political integration in Europe. Today, many countries that were opponents in World War 2 are now close allies, notably Germany, France, and Poland and the US and Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topCitationBibTeX citation:@online{laptev2024,\n  author = {Laptev, Martin},\n  title = {World {War} 2},\n  date = {2024-09-09},\n  url = {https://maptv.github.io/history/ww2},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLaptev, Martin. 2024. “World War 2.” September 9, 2024. https://maptv.github.io/history/ww2.",

    "text": "Setup\n\nHomebrew\nLinux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) users can use Homebrew to install everything needed to follow along with this blog post. First, install Homebrew with the latest .pkg installer for macOS or by running the Example 1 Unix shell code in your terminal.\n\nExample 1  \n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github\\\nusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nIf you are not completely satisfied with the integrated terminal built into your preferred source-code editor or the standalone terminal that comes with your operating system (OS), you can use Homebrew to install a new one. The standalone terminal I use most often is iTerm2, which is only for macOS, but I also have the following multi-OS terminals: Alacritty, Hyper, Kitty, and Tabby.\nAfter installing Homebrew, you can run brew doctor in your terminal to confirm that everything is set up correctly. If the brew command is not available, you need to follow the instructions provided after installation to add brew to your PATH variable.\nOnce Homebrew is ready, you can run the shell code in Example 2 to create a file called Brewfile with the echo shell command and install everything listed in this newly created Brewfile with the brew bundle shell command.\n\nExample 2  \necho 'brew \"gh\"\\nbrew \"git\"\\nbrew \"glab\"\ncask \"github\"\\ncask \"rstudio\"\\ncask \"vscodium\"\ncask \"visual-studio-code\"' &gt; Brewfile\nbrew bundle\n\nThe Brewfile created by the shell code in Example 2 installs:\n\nGit,\nthe command line interfaces (CLIs) for\n\nGitHub and\nGitLab,\n\nthe GitHub Desktop Git Graphical User Interface (GUI), and\nthree source-code editors:\n\nVisual Studio Code (VSCode),\nVSCodium, and\nRStudio.\n\n\nIf you are curious about how I set up my computer, you can take a look at my Brewfile and other configuration files in my setup repo on GitHub and GitLab. I will highlight a few configuration files in Section 4.\n\n\nCodespaces\nAs an alternative to installing tools on your computer, you can use GitHub Codespaces to perform all development tasks remotely. To get a feel for Codespaces, I recommend you first try the github.dev editor.\nBoth Codespaces and github.dev allow you to edit files in any GitHub repository via VSCode in your browser and load your VSCode settings automatically via Settings Sync, but github.dev can be started by going to any repo on GitHub and pressing . or changing the .com in the URL to .dev, e.g. https://github.com/maptv/maptv.github.io to https://github.dev/maptv/maptv.github.io. The github.dev editor starts up fast and is completely free, but comes with restrictions that prevent us from running code, building software, accessing the integrated terminal, or using non-web extensions.\nIn addition to being free of these restrictions, Codespaces allows us to use JupyterLab as the web interface instead of VSCode by appending /?editor=jupyter to the Codespaces URL. If you use a JetBrains integrated development environmentproducts, such as PyCharm (IDE), you can also try appending /?editor=jetbrains to the Codespaces URL and accessing Codespaces via JetBrains Gateway.\nEvery Codespaces instance (codespace) is pre-equipped with commonly used tools. If you want your codespaces to start with additional tools or settings for any tools other than VSCode, you will need to create a repo called dotfiles and enable automatic installation of your configuration files into every codespace you create.\n“Dotfiles” is a general term for files that contain user settings. The term “dotfiles” is derived from hidden files in Unix and Unix-like environments, which have names that start with a dot (.). Despite the origin of the term, not all dotfiles are hidden files.\nIn fact, there is a new convention that places non-hidden configuration files in a hidden directory called .config. Despite the growing popularity of this new convention, many dotfiles are still stored according to the old convention, i.e. as hidden files in the home directory.\nExample 3 shows how the Vim and Neovim text editors differ in their approach to dotfile storage. The Vim configuration file ~/.vimrc follows the old convention, while the Neovim configuration file (~/.config/nvim/init.vim) follows the new convention, where ~ represents the home directory and / is directory delimiter used in Unix paths.\n\nExample 3  \n~\n├── .config\n│   └── nvim\n│       └── init.vim\n└── .vimrc\n\nIf do not have configuration files for any tool other than VSCode and do not need to install anything as part of Codespaces setup, you can forego creating a dotfiles repo and simply enable Settings Sync.\nyou can simply include all of your configuration files in your dotfiles repo with the desired directory structure, e.g. as in Example 3. This way, whenever a codespace is created, its home directory (/home/codespace) will be set up to match your dotfiles repo using symbolic links.\nWhile this automatic dotfile setup approach does not allow you to install any additional tools, it is simple and avoids any installation steps that can significantly slow down build times. Importantly, if GitHub determines that your dotfiles repo contains a setup script based on its naming convention, it will not run the setup script and ignore any other files in the repo, because of the expectation that users with setup scripts will want to organize their configuration files themselves.\nFor more information on dotfiles, check out the resources at https://dotfiles.github.io. Regardless o you do have way to configure VSCode, you do not have to set up Codespaces. Instead you can any of the steps below https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#settings-sync\nThe setup script can install\nRegardless of whether you have a dotfiles repo, you can use Settings Sync to maintain consistency between your local and remote development environments. keep all of your configuration files in a repo called dotfiles. Instead\nbut we can add anything that may be missing with a Brewfile and a setup script.\nIn other words, we have the option to simply put configuration files in our dotfiles repo and not install anything.\nMy configuration files have dependencies that are not included in the default Codespaces image, so the configuration-files-only approach would not work for me. Codespaces of the expectation\nI chose setup.sh as the name of my setup script because it was shortest name that followed the naming convention set by GitHub and had the .sh filename extension.\nFor my configurationI need at very least convenient feature is disabled when we include a setup script in our dotfiles repo, because\nThe tools listed in the Brewfile can be installed with a shell script that GitHub will run when building the Codespace.\nIt is essential that your setup script be added to Git as an executable script! I only needed to run the shell code in Example 4 once for Git to change the mode of setup.sh and remember forever that its access permissions include execution (x).\n\nExample 4  \ngit add setup.sh --chmod=+x\n\nMaintaining local and remote settings may be challenging, but Homebrew makes it easier with the $HOMEBREW_PREFIX environment variable. This variable contains the Homebrew installation path that matches your computer hardware and OS.\nBefore you can use $HOMEBREW_PREFIX, the brew command needs to be added to your PATH. To ensure Codespaces setup, I added the code in Example 5 to my .zshrc.\n\nExample 5  \n\n\n.zshrc\n\nif [[ \"$(uname)\" == 'Linux' ]]; then\n    eval \"$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\nfi\n\n\nTo prevent conflicts with web browser keybindings, you can install Codespaces as a Progressive Web App (PWA) by clicking on the “Install Codespaces” icon at the end of the URL bar in Chrome or any Chromium-based web browser. When running as a PWA, Codespaces behaves like a desktop application and can thus provide a familiar user experience on any computer!\nOn macOS, the PWA installation location is ~/Applications/Chrome Apps.localized.\n\n\nRepository\nBefore you can benefit from everything GitHub and GitLab have to offer, you will need a GitHub and/or GitLab account and an SSH key. Even though there are other authentication methods, SSH keys are still the easiest way to authenticate to GitHub and GitLab.\nYou can create a repo using the web interface of https://github.com or https://gitlab.com in your browser, but the best way to start a new project is using the CLI for GitHub or GitLab in your terminal. First, run gh auth login or glab auth login and follow the prompts to authenticate via your web browser or with an authentication token.\nThe GitHub CLI allows you to add an SSH key to your account during or after authentication. The GitLab CLI does not handle SSH keys during authentication, but has a similar command for adding an SSH key to your GitLab account.\nAfter authentication and SSH key setup, you can run the code in either of the code chunks in Example 6 to set up your local and remote repos and create a Quarto website project in the local repo. You can create shell alias that combine all of the repo creation steps like I did in my .zshrc.\n\nExample 6  \n\nGitHubGitLab\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\ngh repo create REPONAME --add-readme --clone --public\ncd REPONAME\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\nglab repo create REPONAME --readme --defaultBranch main --public\ncd REPONAME\ngit pull origin main\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to backup my repos on both GitHub and GitLab, I set up each local repo to have two origin remote URLs using the code as shown in Example 7. With this setting, running git push in my local repo updates my remote repos on both GitHub and GitLab.\n\nExample 7  \ngit remote add lab git@gitlab.com:maptv/maptv.gitlab.io\ngit remote add hub git@github.com:maptv/maptv.github.io\ngit remote set-url --add origin $(git remote get-url lab)",

    "text": "Git workflow\nWhen I want to add or update the content on my site, I go through the steps in the standard Git workflow shown in Figure 2. Every time I “push” a collection of changes called a commit to my maptv.github.io repo on GitHub, a continuous integration (CI) system called GitHub Actions automatically completes the steps required to build and publish my website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[working&lt;br/&gt;directory]-.git&lt;br/&gt;add.-&gt;B{{staging&lt;br/&gt;area}}-.git&lt;br/&gt;commit.-&gt;C([local&lt;br/&gt;repo])-.git&lt;br/&gt;push.-&gt;D(remote&lt;br/&gt;repo)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Git workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShell aliases\nTo make it easier to make incremental changes to my website and frequently release new content, I combined all of the git shell commands in Figure 2 into shell aliases. You can add shell aliases to a shell configuration file like .bashrc or .zshrc on your computer to shorten one or more commands and any associated command arguments.\nThe git commit aliases in the .zshrc file in my setup repo on GitHub and GitLab target different groups of files for inclusion in the next commit. For example, cmp targets staged files, camp targets tracked files, a.cmp targets files in the current directory, and aacmp targets files in the repo.\nExample 8 shows the aacmp alias as an example of the shell alias syntax. The mnemonic device for this alias is add all, commit with a message, and push.\n\nExample 8  \n\n\n.zshrc\n\nalias aacmp=\"func() { git add --all && git commit --message \\\n    \\\"$(echo '${*:-$(echo $(git diff --name-status --cached \\\n    | tr \"[:space:]\" \" \"))}')\\\" && git push; }; func\"\n\n\nAliases like aacmp allow me to enter free-form commit messages directly on the command line without quotes, e.g. aacmp edit first post. If you decide to try one of these aliases, please exercise extreme caution as any un-escaped or un-quoted metacharacters may yield surprising effects instead of being included verbatim in the commit message, e.g. * is replaced by all of the file and directory names in the current directory!\nIf no commit message is provided after the aliases, a generic commit message is created that includes the change type and name of each changed file. In Section 4.2, I describe how I used this generic commit message approach to further simplify the Git workflow.\n\n\nKeybindings\nAn alternative to a shell alias that combines git commands is to use a keyboard shortcut in a Git Graphical User Interface (GUI) such as GitHub Desktop or the Git interface in a code editor like VSCode, VSCodium, or RStudio. I use keyboard shortcuts in VSCode and VSCodium to send shell commands to the integrated terminal without moving my focus away from the files I am editing.\nI created different shortcuts to control which files are included in each commit: ⌥⇧F for the current file only, ⌥⇧S for already staged files, ⌥⇧T for all tracked files, and ⌥⇧U for all files including untracked files. I also have keyboard shortcuts that affect a specific directory (and all of its subdirectories): ⌥⇧D for the current file’s directory, ⌥⇧. for shell’s current directory, ⌥⇧C for the current working directory according to VSCode/VSCodium, ⌥⇧W for the Workspace directory.\nExample 9 displays the ⌥⇧F shortcut as an example of the VSCode/VSCodium shortcut syntax. This shortcut uses the escape code for the return key (\\u000D) to run several git commands and predefined variables to insert the absolute (${file}) and relative (${relativeFile}) path to the currently open file.\n\nExample 9  \n\n\nkeybindings.json\n\n{\n  \"key\": \"shift+alt+f\",\n  \"command\": \"workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence\", \"args\": { \"text\":\n    \"git add ${file} && git commit -m \\\"M ${relativeFile}\\\" && git push\\u000D\" },\n  \"when\": \"terminalIsOpen\"\n}\n\n\nIf you want to set up similar shortcuts for yourself, take a look at my keybindings.json in my setup repo on GitHub and GitLab. As you create keyboard shortcuts, please be mindful of keybinding conflicts that may arise.\nTo set up a keyboard shortcut that runs a series of steps rather than a single line of shell code, I suggest you use the VSCode/VSCodium Tasks mechanism, a system designed to automate software build tasks. The default keyboard shortcut to run all tasks in a local or global task.json file is ⌃⇧B on Linux/Windows or ⌘⇧B on Mac (mnemonic: B is for Build), but you can bind other shortcuts to specific tasks.\nIf you use a text editor like Vim or Emacs, you can create keybindings for Vim plugins like fugitive or Emacs packages like magit that run through the entire Git workflow. Example 10 shows the Vim+fugitive equivalent of my ⌥⇧F VSCode/VSCodium keybinding.\n\nExample 10  \n\n\n.vimrc\n\nnnoremap &lt;A-S-f&gt; :Gw&lt;bar&gt;G! commit -m \"M \"%&lt;bar&gt;G! push&lt;CR&gt;\n\n\nThe drawback of my keyboard shortcut approach for the Git workflow is that it produces generic commit messages that are no very informative. Anyone reading the messages will not be able to tell what changes were made and more importantly why the changes were made.\nTo automatically generate commit messages based on the currently staged changes, we can use a Large Language Model (LLM). Generative artificial intelligence models like LLMs tend to be large in size and have atypical computational requirements, so I will save my adventures with LLMs for a different post.\nI really enjoy using Git, especially with shell aliases in my terminal and keyboard shortcuts in my favorite text editors. If we ever collaborate on a project together, you can be sure that I will insist on using Git!",

To set up a Codespace, you can remove the lines that start with cask from the Brewfile provided in Example 1 and add the file to a repo called dotfiles and along with a setup.sh file like the one shown in Example 2.\n\nExample 2  \n\n\nsetup.sh\n\necho | /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n(echo; echo 'eval \"$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"') &gt;&gt; /home/codespace/.profile\neval \"$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\nbrew bundle\n\n\n\n\nPublishing overview\nOnce you are done setting up your computer or Codespace, you create a Quarto website template and make your site publicly available on the internet using one of the many available publishing services. To explore and assess different publishing workflows and free website hosting options, I set up my personal website on four different web hosts: Quarto Pub, Netlify, GitHub Pages, and GitLab Pages.\nThere are so many different ways to publish a Quarto site that I decided to come up with a naming system for Quarto publishing methods. The naming system derives a code for each publishing method from the numbered lists in the Quarto publishing documentation. For example, I refer to the two methods to publish to Quarto Pub as Q1 and Q2:\nTable 1 uses this naming system in its Code column to identify the publishing methods I discuss in this blog post. Each publishing method targets a particular web Host, Renders content locally or on a remote server, and deploys sites using either the quarto publish or the git push shell Command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nHost\nRender\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nG1\nGitHub\nLocal\npush\n\n\nG2\nGitHub\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nG3\nGitHub\nRemote\npush\n\n\nN1\nNetlify\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nN2\nNetlify\nLocal\npush\n\n\nN3\nNetlify\nRemote\npush\n\n\nQ1\nQuarto\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nQ2\nQuarto\nRemote\npush\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Quarto website publishing methods\n\n\n\n\n\nGit workflow\nThe first publishing method I tried for my personal site was G1, which requires the use of Git to push all website content to a Git provider like GitHub or GitLab. After I set up GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages, I could update my website on both of these web hosts just by going through the standard Git workflow shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[working&lt;br/&gt;directory]-.git&lt;br/&gt;add.-&gt;B{{staging&lt;br/&gt;area}}-.git&lt;br/&gt;commit.-&gt;C([local&lt;br/&gt;repo])-.git&lt;br/&gt;push.-&gt;D(remote&lt;br/&gt;repo)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Git workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to make incremental changes to my website and frequently release new content, I combined all of the git shell commands in Figure 2 into a shell alias. You can add shell aliases to a shell configuration file like .bashrc or .zshrc on your computer to shorten commands or combine any sequence of commands into one step.\nThe aacmp alias in the .zshrc file in my setup repo allows me to enter a free-form commit message directly on the command line without quotes, e.g. qp edit first blog. If you decide to try my aacmp alias, please exercise extreme caution as any un-escaped or un-quoted metacharacters may yield surprising effects instead of being included verbatim in the commit message. For example, qp * will list the contents of the current directory in the commit message in place of the asterisk!\nAn alternative to a shell alias that combines git commands is a keyboard shortcut in Git-enabled GUI. Example 3 shows two files, tasks.json and update.sh, that we can use to set up VSCode, VSCodium, and GitHub Codespaces to go through the Git workflow whenever we press Ctrl+Shift+B on Linux/Windows or ⌘+Shift+B on Mac (mnemonic: B is for Build).\n\nExample 3  \n\nupdate.shtasks.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis mechanism is called Tasks and is used to automate software build tasks, which can include any steps required to build and publish a website. Importantly, the Tasks mechanism requires that the tasks.json file be added to the .vscode directory and that we enable execution of the update.sh script by running chmod +x update.sh in our project root.\nShell aliases and keyboard shortcuts can greatly facilitate the Git workflow which is essential not only for G1, but also G3, N3, and Q2. Unlike these other publishing methods, G1 leads to messy commits that contain changes to both source and output files.\n\n\nquarto publish\nTo have cleaner commits, I switched from G1 to G2 by adding quarto publish to my publishing workflow. With G2, I can track changes to my source files on my main branch and publish my output files to GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages from my gh-pages branch.\nQ1, N1, and G2 all use quarto publish to render website content locally and then deploy it in one fell swoop. If you do not plan to use the Git version control system or the advanced features offered by GitHub, GitLab, or Netlify, then I recommend deploying your site to Quarto Pub by running quarto publish quarto-pub (Q1 in Table 1).\nLike Q1, N1 is a deployment method that does not require Git and makes it possible to deploy our site with a single shell command: quarto publish netlify. N1 provides access to the advanced web hosting features offered by Netlify and can even render content as long as code execution is frozen.\nTo deploy my site to GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, and Netlify, I combined G2 and N2. When I run quarto publish gh-pages, Quarto renders my site into my output directory, copies the output directory contents to the gh-pages branch of my local repo, and then commits and pushes the changes to my remote repos on GitHub and GitLab, which triggers Netlify to build my site from the gh-pages branch.\nTo summarize the Quarto publishing methods I discussed so far, Q1 and N1 are easy to configure and use, N2 automatically builds sites from Git repos, G1 is not recommended because it pollutes commits with output file changes, and G2 is more difficult to set up and use but provides clean commits and a nice separation of source and output files.\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nAll of the publishing methods I have discussed so far require us to generate output files locally by rendering our source files. In contrast, Q2, G3, and N3 make it possible to skip local rendering in favor of relying on GitHub Actions to handle all of the necessary steps.\nG3 is noteworthy, because it offers the same convenience of G1 but without messy commits that mix changes to source and output files. An added bonus of G3 is that rendering with GitHub Actions provides a reproducible computational environment that is not dependent on what you have installed on your computer.\nInstead of using GitHub Actions, I could have used GitLab CI/CD to build my site. I decided not to go down this route because the Quarto dev team has many GitHub Actions workflows available but currently no official support for GitLab CI/CD.\nBefore trying to use GitHub Actions or any other continuous integration systems in your publishing workflow, I suggest getting used to working with quarto publish (Q1, G2, or N1). You can always set up other publishing methods later without sacrificing anything, because all of the publishing methods except G1 can be combined together.\nIn Section 4, I will walk through the setup of both G2 and G3 to provide the option of rendering locally by running quarto publish or rendering remotely with GitHub Actions by pushing to the main branch. Along the way, I will share many practical tips and general advice that you can apply to any project.",

    "text": "Publishing setup\n\nRepo setup\nBefore you can use GitHub Actions to publish your site, you will need a GitHub, an SSH key, and a repo like maptv.github.io that has a default branch called main and another branch which must be called gh-pages. If you want to publish on GitLab Pages, you will also need a GitLab account and an analogous GitLab repo like maptv.gitlab.io.\nYou can create the repo and the gh-pages branch using the web interface of https://github.com or https://gitlab.com in your browser, but the best way to start a new project is using the CLI for GitHub or GitLab in your terminal. First, run gh auth login or glab auth login and follow the prompts to authenticate via your web browser or with an authentication token.\nThe GitHub CLI allows you to add an SSH key to your account during or after authentication. The GitLab CLI does not handle SSH keys during authentication, but has a similar command for adding an SSH key to your GitLab account.\nAfter authentication and SSH key setup, you can run the code in either of the code chunks in Example 4 to set up your local and remote repos and create a Quarto website project in the local repo. You can create shell alias that combine all of the repo creation steps like I did in my .zshrc.\n\nExample 4  \n\nGitHubGitLab\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir -p USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\ngh repo create USERNAME.github.io --add-readme --clone --public\ncd SITENAME\nquarto create project website USERNAME.github.io\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir -p USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\nglab repo create USERNAME.gitlab.io --readme --defaultBranch main --public\ncd SITENAME\ngit pull origin main\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main\nquarto create project website USERNAME.gitlab.io\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to maintain my site on both GitHub and GitLab Pages, I set up my local repo cloned to have two origin remote URLs using the code as shown in Example 5. Now, running quarto publish or git push in my local repo, updates my content on both GitHub and GitLab.\n\nExample 5  \ngit remote add lab git@gitlab.com:maptv/maptv.gitlab.io\ngit remote add hub git@github.com:maptv/maptv.github.io\ngit remote set-url --add origin $(git remote get-url lab)\n\nIf you want to have your website hosted on GitHub Pages, you will need to set gh-pages as your source branch in your repo settings. For GitLab Pages, you will need to add a .gitlab-ci.yml file to your repo and update your _quarto.yml file as shown in Example 6 to include .gitlab-ci.yml as a resource in your output directory.\n\nExample 6  \n\n.gitlab-ci.yml_quarto.yml\n\n\n# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/introduction.html#customize-the-default-folder\npages:\n  script: echo \"The site will be deployed to $CI_PAGES_URL\"\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - \".\"\n  publish: \".\"\n  only:\n    - gh-pages\n\n\nauthor:\n  - name: Martin Laptev\n    url: https://maptv.github.io\n\n\n\n\nBy default, GitLab Pages includes a random hash in site URLs. To shorten the URL of my GitLab Pages site to &lt;maptv.gitlab.io&gt;, I had to uncheck Use unique domain under Deploy &gt; Pages in the GitLab sidebar.\nAt this point, we have completed G2 setup and you should be able to run quarto publish gh-pages from your main branch to render your site and deploy it to GitHub and/or GitLab Pages. Deploying with quarto publish at least once is a prerequisite for setting up any of the publishing methods that rely on GitHub Actions, because quarto publish creates a _publish.yml file in the root of your project that is required for publishing via GitHub Actions.\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nIn addition to the steps described above, G3 setup requires that we create a .github/workflows directory and add a YAML file to that directory. Example 7 contains the gh-pages.yml file I use for my own site and the shell code that can used to obtain this file.\n\nExample 7  \n\ncurlgh-pages.yml\n\n\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\ncd .github/workflows\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptv/maptv.github.io/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml\n\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n\nname: Quarto Publish\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n        with:\n          version: '1.4.489'\n          tinytex: true\n\n      - name: Install R\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n          r-version: '4.2.0'\n\n      - name: Install R Dependencies\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2\n        with:\n          cache-version: 1\n\n      - name: Install Python and Dependencies\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n        with:\n          python-version: '3.10'\n          cache: 'pip'\n      - run: pip install jupyter\n      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Push To GitLab\n        env:\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n        run: |\n          echo Starting to push gh-pages branch to GitLab\n          git config user.name \"maptv\"\n          git config user.email \"129316885+maptv@users.noreply.github.com\"\n          git remote set-url origin \"https://oauth2:${token}@gitlab.com/maptv/maptv.gitlab.io\"\n          git push origin gh-pages\n\n\n\n\nThe gh-pages.yml file in Example 7 installs Quarto, the R and Python programming languages, and the packages in the renv.lock and requirements.txt files. If you do not need R and/or Python, you can remove any unnecessary portions of the file.\nTo modify the Python files that are installed by GitHub Actions, you can edit the requirements.txt file in your repo. To update your renv.lock file so that it includes all of the R packages your site requires, run renv::snapshot() in an R session or Rscript -e renv::snapshot() in a shell.\nAfter pushing the gh-pages.yml file, you can visit the Actions tab in your remote repo on GitHub to check the progress of the deployment of your site. If your site did not build successfully, you can go through the logs to try to diagnose the problem.\nI added a “Push to GitLab” step to my gh-pages.yml to make GitHub Actions push my remote gh-pages to GitLab so that my site is kept in sync on both GitHub and GitLab Pages. This required manually creating a token on GitLab and adding it to GitHub, which I accomplished using the GitHub CLI as shown in Example 8.\n\nExample 8  \ngh secret set GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN\n\nAfter the setup described above, I now have two options for publishing my Quarto site: quarto publish and 2) git push. In addition to GitHub and GitLab Pages, both of these options automatically update my site on Netlify via N2.\nTo also automatically update my site on Quarto Pub, I created a separate GitHub Actions workflow by adding another YAML file to the .github/workflows directory in my repo. Example 9 shows my quarto-pub.yml file and the shell code that can be used to obtain it.\n\nExample 9  \n\ncurlquarto-pub.yml\n\n\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\ncd .github/workflows\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptv/maptv.github.io/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml\n\n\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [pages-build-deployment]\n    types: [completed]\n\nname: Update Quarto Pub\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out main repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Check out _site\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          ref: gh-pages\n          path: _site\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n\n      - name: Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: quarto-pub\n          render: false\n          QUARTO_PUB_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.QUARTO_PUB_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n          GITHUB_USERNAME: maptv\n\n\n\n\nMy quarto-pub.yml file is based on Q2, but it runs upon completion of the pages-build-deployment workflow instead of a push to main. I changed the workflow trigger so that it runs after my GitHub Pages site is built, regardless of whether I triggered the build by running quarto publish gh-pages or pushing to main.\nFigure 3 summarizes all of the steps that occur during my Quarto publishing workflow. This workflow allows me to publish my site on four web hosts every time I run quarto publish gh-pages (G2) or git push (G3)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G2.-&gt;B[local&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G2.-&gt;C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    B[local&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G2.-&gt;D[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;F[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G3.-&gt;D[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;G[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;main]\n    C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.N2.-&gt;E[Netlify]\n    C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.Q2.-&gt;H[Quarto&lt;br/&gt;Pub]\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Quarto publishing workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far I have only noticed one difference between the four web hosts I use for my site: GitHub Pages is the only web host that properly differentiates between internal and external links. All of the other web hosts include the external link icon on all links regardless of whether they target my site or an external site.\nI tried unsuccessfully to solve this issue by setting the link-external-filter property to a regular expression. If you notice a problem with the link-external-icon feature on other web hosts, I suggest switching to GitHub Pages.",

    "section": "Customizing Quarto sites",
    "text": "Customizing Quarto sites\n\nSite navigation\nOnce your site is built and published, you can make it easier to navigate with a customized navigation bar (navbar) and sidebar, as described in the Quarto documentation. Check out the _quarto.yml files for my site and the Quarto documentation site to see how the navigation components are set up.\nIn my navbar, I added toggle buttons for reader mode and dark mode. The names of the other icons on right side of the navbar are included in the sidebar.\n\n\nHTML blocks\nMy navbar also provides the current date and time in Dec ordinal (deco) format, which counts the years since 1 BC and the days since March 1. Dec is a calendar and time system that I created and use throughout my blog.\nTo add a custom timestamp to the navbar, I put a &lt;script&gt; element that runs time.js in an HTML block in every Quarto markdown (.qmd) file, as shown in Example 10. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel wrote about HTML blocks as part of her A Quarto tip a day project.\n\nExample 10  \n\n*.qmdtime.js\n\n\n```{=html}\n&lt;script src=\"time.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML blocks are useful for running JavaScript code in the context of a single page on your site without affecting the others. I also use HTML blocks to add a &lt;style&gt; element to my .qmd files as a last ditch effort to fine tune the style of my site.\nBefore I resort to the &lt;style&gt; element approach, I try writing CSS in my style.css, light.css, and dark.css files. So far, this approach has been sufficient to make any styling changes I want, but if it every fails, I can use JavaScript to override the default styling provided by Quarto by modifying style attributes, which have the highest specificity in CSS.\n\n\nPost-render script\nI wanted to my blog’s listing page to show dates in the same format as the navbar timestamp. To accomplish this, I used a post-render script written in the Python programming language.\nPre- and post-render scripts are set as project options in the _quarto.yml file in the root of your Quarto project. Example 11 shows the date.py post-render script and how this script is referenced in _quarto.yml.\n\nExample 11  \n\n_quarto.ymldate.py\n\n\nauthor:\n  - name: Martin Laptev\n    url: https://maptv.github.io\ndate-format: x\n\n\n# https://howardhinnant.github.io/date_algorithms.html#days_from_civil\nimport bs4\n\ndef unix2doty(ms):\n    dote = ms / 86400000 + 719468\n    cykl = (\n        dote if dote &gt;= 0\n        else dote - 146096\n    ) // 146097\n    dotc = dote - cykl * 146097\n    yotc = (dotc\n        - dotc // 1460\n        + dotc // 36524\n        - dotc // 146096\n    ) // 365\n    return [\n        int(yotc + cykl * 400),\n        dotc - (yotc * 365\n            + yotc // 4\n            - yotc // 100\n        )\n    ]\n\nwith open(\"_site/list/index.html\") as infile:\n    txt = infile.read()\n    soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(txt, features=\"html.parser\")\nfor div in soup.find_all(\"div\", {\"class\": \"card-file-modified\"}):\n    if \"+\" not in div.text:\n        y, d = unix2doty(int(div.text))\n        div.string.replace_with(f\"{y:&gt;04}+{d.__floor__():&gt;03}\")\nfor div in soup.find_all(\"div\", {\"class\": \"listing-reading-time\"}):\n    if \"min\" in div.text:\n        div.string.replace_with(f\"{(int(div.text.split()[0]) / 1.44).__floor__()} milliday\")\nwith open(\"_site/list/index.html\", \"w\") as outfile:\n    outfile.write(str(soup))\n\n\n\n\nNormally, formatting dates in Quarto is as easy as setting the date-format YAML property. In my case it was more difficult, because I wanted dates based on Dec, the calendar and time system I created, instead of the ubiquitous Gregorian calendar.\nTo facilitate the calculations in date.py, I set date-format to x in my _metadata.yml file so all of the dates would be in millisecond UNIX time and I would not have to deal with Gregorian calendar date formats or time zones. After all of the dates are generated, my date.py script traverses the HTML in the output directory using Beautiful Soup and converts millisecond UNIX time dates into Dec dates (year+day).\n\n\nPandoc filter\nIn addition to customizing dates on the listing page of my blog, I wanted to customize the date format in every blog post. To complete this task, I used a Lua script as a Pandoc filter.\nPandoc is a program that converts documents into practically any format. The “pan” in Pandoc comes from the Ancient Greek word for all. Pandoc strives to convert all document formats, just like Pangea contained all the land and a panacea solves all problems.\nQuarto uses Pandoc to convert markdown files into target format(s) like html or pdf. If the source files contain executable code, Quarto executes the code via one of two computational engines: Jupyter or Knitr. Figure 4 shows the Quarto workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[qmd&lt;br/&gt;ipynb]-.Knitr&lt;br/&gt;Jupyter.-&gt;B((md))-.Pandoc with&lt;br/&gt;Lua filters.-&gt;C(html&lt;br/&gt;pdf&lt;br/&gt;docx&lt;br/&gt;etc.)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Quarto rendering workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s Quarto tip series includes a similar Quarto workflow mermaid diagram and her “Hello, Quarto!” rstudio::conf(2022) keynote with Julia Stewart Lowndes contains truly beautiful Quarto workflow images by Allison Horst: 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nQuarto controls Pandoc, Jupyter, and Knitr in two ways: 1) with arguments passed to the Quarto CLI commands and 2) with YAML key-value pairs in .qmd, .ipynb, or .yml files.\nExample 12 shows how I set up every qmd file to generate the current date in millisecond UNIX time and designated date.lua as a Pandoc filter. Unlike post-render scripts, Pandoc filters are executed during the creation of the output files.\n\nExample 12  \n\n*.qmddate.lua\n\n\ndate: now\ndate-format: x\nfilters: date.lua\n\n\n-- https://howardhinnant.github.io/date_algorithms.html#days_from_civil\nfunction unix2deco(ms)\n  local dote = ms / 86400000 + 719468\n  local cykl = (\n    dote &gt;= 0 and dote\n    or dote - 146096\n  ) // 146097\n  local dotc = dote - cykl * 146097\n  local yotc = (\n    dotc - dotc // 1460\n    + dotc // 36524\n    - dotc // 146096\n  ) // 365\n  return string.format(\n    \"%s+%03d\",\n    math.floor(yotc + cykl * 400),\n    math.floor(dotc - (yotc * 365\n      + yotc // 4\n      - yotc // 100)))\nend\n\nlocal function to_decalendar(date)\n  local date = pandoc.utils.stringify(date)\n  local unix = date:match(\"(%d+)\")\n  return date:gsub(unix, unix2deco(unix))\nend\n\nfunction Meta(m)\n  m.date = to_decalendar(m.date)\n  return m\nend\n\n\n\n\nAll three of the customizations I described above convert millisecond UNIX time into a custom date format, but you can adapt these approaches to make all sorts of edits to your Quarto site. HTML blocks can run JavaScript which excels at making content dynamic and interactive, pre- and post-render scripts can be in any programming language, while Pandoc filters are written in Lua and modify output during rendering.\nComing up next on my blog is a post that Observable graphics.

Announced on 2022+149 by Posit CEO JJ Allaire, Quarto is already taking the world🌐by storm⛈️!\nI strongly believe that everyone, regardless of their background and current technical skill level, can learn and benefit from Quarto. Getting started with Quarto is easy thanks to its excellent documentation and vibrant community of enthusiastic users and developers.\nRather than repeat the basic information already available elsewhere, I will share some advanced techniques along with the fundamental knowledge needed to understand how they work. The topics I cover are very technical, but my goal is to make the content on my blog as accessible as possible.\nThe first topic I will delve into is creating and publishing a website with Quarto. To follow the Quarto documentation on creating a website, you will need Visual Studio Code (VSCode), VSCodium, RStudio, or a terminal.",

    "text": "Publishing Quarto sites\n\nInstalling tools\nIf you use macOS, Linux, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can install all of the aforementioned tools with the Homebrew package manager. To install everything you will need to follow along with this blog post, you can first install Homebrew and then run brew bundle in a directory that contains the Brewfile shown in Example 1.\n\nExample 1  \n\n\nBrewfile\n\nbrew \"gh\"\nbrew \"git\"\nbrew \"glab\"\ncask \"github\"\ncask \"quarto\"\ncask \"rstudio\"\ncask \"vscodium\"\ncask \"visual-studio-code\"\nvscode \"quarto.quarto\"\nvscode \"REditorSupport.r\"\n\n\nUsing a package manager like Homebrew to install all the requirements with a single shell command like brew bundle is the fastest and easiest way to get ready to follow along with this blog post. If you are curious about how I set up my computer, you can take a look at my Brewfile and other configuration files in my setup repository (repo) on GitHub and GitLab.\nApart from RStudio, VSCode, and VSCodium, the Brewfile in Example 1 will install the Git version control system, the GitHub and GitLab command line interfaces (CLIs), and GitHub Desktop, a Git Graphical User Interface (GUI). For more information on Git, a tool used by 93% of software developers worldwide according to survey results published by StackOverflow on 2022+314, take a look at the “GitHub for supporting, reusing, contributing, and failing safely” post by Allison Horst and Julie Lowndes on the Openscapes blog.\nAs an alternative to installing tools on your computer, you can use the web interface provided by GitHub Codespaces. To set up a Codespace, you can remove the lines that start with cask from the Brewfile provided in Example 1 and add the file to a repo called dotfiles and along with a setup.sh file like the one shown in Example 2.\n\nExample 2  \n\n\nsetup.sh\n\necho | /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n(echo; echo 'eval \"$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"') &gt;&gt; /home/codespace/.profile\neval \"$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\nbrew bundle\n\n\n\n\nPublishing overview\nOnce you are done setting up your computer or Codespace, you create a Quarto website template and make your site publicly available on the internet using one of the many available publishing services. To explore and assess different publishing workflows and free website hosting options, I set up my personal website on four different web hosts: Quarto Pub, Netlify, GitHub Pages, and GitLab Pages.\nThere are so many different ways to publish a Quarto site that I decided to come up with a naming system for Quarto publishing methods. The naming system derives a code for each publishing method from the numbered lists in the Quarto publishing documentation. For example, I refer to the two methods to publish to Quarto Pub as Q1 and Q2:\nTable 1 uses this naming system in its Code column to identify the publishing methods I discuss in this blog post. Each publishing method targets a particular web Host, Renders content locally or on a remote server, and deploys sites using either the quarto publish or the git push shell Command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nHost\nRender\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nG1\nGitHub\nLocal\npush\n\n\nG2\nGitHub\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nG3\nGitHub\nRemote\npush\n\n\nN1\nNetlify\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nN2\nNetlify\nLocal\npush\n\n\nN3\nNetlify\nRemote\npush\n\n\nQ1\nQuarto\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nQ2\nQuarto\nRemote\npush\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Quarto website publishing methods\n\n\n\n\n\nGit workflow\nThe first publishing method I tried for my personal site was G1, which requires the use of Git to push all website content to a Git provider like GitHub or GitLab. After I set up GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages, I could update my website on both of these web hosts just by going through the standard Git workflow shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[working&lt;br/&gt;directory]-.git&lt;br/&gt;add.-&gt;B{{staging&lt;br/&gt;area}}-.git&lt;br/&gt;commit.-&gt;C([local&lt;br/&gt;repo])-.git&lt;br/&gt;push.-&gt;D(remote&lt;br/&gt;repo)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Git workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to make incremental changes to my website and frequently release new content, I combined all of the git shell commands in Figure 2 into a shell alias. You can add shell aliases to a shell configuration file like .bashrc or .zshrc on your computer to shorten commands or combine any sequence of commands into one step.\nThe aacmp alias in the .zshrc file in my setup repo allows me to enter a free-form commit message directly on the command line without quotes, e.g. qp edit first blog. If you decide to try my aacmp alias, please exercise extreme caution as any un-escaped or un-quoted metacharacters may yield surprising effects instead of being included verbatim in the commit message. For example, qp * will list the contents of the current directory in the commit message in place of the asterisk!\nAn alternative to a shell alias that combines git commands is a keyboard shortcut in Git-enabled GUI. Example 3 shows two files, tasks.json and update.sh, that we can use to set up VSCode, VSCodium, and GitHub Codespaces to go through the Git workflow whenever we press Ctrl+Shift+B on Linux/Windows or ⌘+Shift+B on Mac (mnemonic: B is for Build).\n\nExample 3  \n\nupdate.shtasks.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis mechanism is called Tasks and is used to automate software build tasks, which can include any steps required to build and publish a website. Importantly, the Tasks mechanism requires that the tasks.json file be added to the .vscode directory and that we enable execution of the update.sh script by running chmod +x update.sh in our project root.\nShell aliases and keyboard shortcuts can greatly facilitate the Git workflow which is essential not only for G1, but also G3, N3, and Q2. Unlike these other publishing methods, G1 leads to messy commits that contain changes to both source and output files.\n\n\nquarto publish\nTo have cleaner commits, I switched from G1 to G2 by adding quarto publish to my publishing workflow. With G2, I can track changes to my source files on my main branch and publish my output files to GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages from my gh-pages branch.\nQ1, N1, and G2 all use quarto publish to render website content locally and then deploy it in one fell swoop. If you do not plan to use the Git version control system or the advanced features offered by GitHub, GitLab, or Netlify, then I recommend deploying your site to Quarto Pub by running quarto publish quarto-pub (Q1 in Table 1).\nLike Q1, N1 is a deployment method that does not require Git and makes it possible to deploy our site with a single shell command: quarto publish netlify. N1 provides access to the advanced web hosting features offered by Netlify and can even render content as long as code execution is frozen.\nTo deploy my site to GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, and Netlify, I combined G2 and N2. When I run quarto publish gh-pages, Quarto renders my site into my output directory, copies the output directory contents to the gh-pages branch of my local repo, and then commits and pushes the changes to my remote repos on GitHub and GitLab, which triggers Netlify to build my site from the gh-pages branch.\nTo summarize the Quarto publishing methods I discussed so far, Q1 and N1 are easy to configure and use, N2 automatically builds sites from Git repos, G1 is not recommended because it pollutes commits with output file changes, and G2 is more difficult to set up and use but provides clean commits and a nice separation of source and output files.\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nAll of the publishing methods I have discussed so far require us to generate output files locally by rendering our source files. In contrast, Q2, G3, and N3 make it possible to skip local rendering in favor of relying on GitHub Actions to handle all of the necessary steps.\nG3 is noteworthy, because it offers the same convenience of G1 but without messy commits that mix changes to source and output files. An added bonus of G3 is that rendering with GitHub Actions provides a reproducible computational environment that is not dependent on what you have installed on your computer.\nInstead of using GitHub Actions, I could have used GitLab CI/CD to build my site. I decided not to go down this route because the Quarto dev team has many GitHub Actions workflows available but currently no official support for GitLab CI/CD.\nBefore trying to use GitHub Actions or any other continuous integration systems in your publishing workflow, I suggest getting used to working with quarto publish (Q1, G2, or N1). You can always set up other publishing methods later without sacrificing anything, because all of the publishing methods except G1 can be combined together.\nIn Section 4, I will walk through the setup of both G2 and G3 to provide the option of rendering locally by running quarto publish or rendering remotely with GitHub Actions by pushing to the main branch. Along the way, I will share many practical tips and general advice that you can apply to any project.",

    "section": "Publishing setup",
    "text": "Publishing setup\n\nRepo setup\nBefore you can use GitHub Actions to publish your site, you will need a GitHub, an SSH key, and a repo like maptv.github.io that has a default branch called main and another branch which must be called gh-pages. If you want to publish on GitLab Pages, you will also need a GitLab account and an analogous GitLab repo like maptv.gitlab.io.\nYou can create the repo and the gh-pages branch using the web interface of https://github.com or https://gitlab.com in your browser, but the best way to start a new project is using the CLI for GitHub or GitLab in your terminal. First, run gh auth login or glab auth login and follow the prompts to authenticate via your web browser or with an authentication token.\nThe GitHub CLI allows you to add an SSH key to your account during or after authentication. The GitLab CLI does not handle SSH keys during authentication, but has a similar command for adding an SSH key to your GitLab account.\nAfter authentication and SSH key setup, you can run the code in either of the code chunks in Example 4 to set up your local and remote repos and create a Quarto website project in the local repo. You can create shell alias that combine all of the repo creation steps like I did in my .zshrc.\n\nExample 4  \n\nGitHubGitLab\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir -p USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\ngh repo create USERNAME.github.io --add-readme --clone --public\ncd SITENAME\nquarto create project website USERNAME.github.io\n\n\ncd # start in home directory\nmkdir -p USERNAME\ncd USERNAME\nglab repo create USERNAME.gitlab.io --readme --defaultBranch main --public\ncd SITENAME\ngit pull origin main\ngit branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main\nquarto create project website USERNAME.gitlab.io\n\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to maintain my site on both GitHub and GitLab Pages, I set up my local repo cloned to have two origin remote URLs using the code as shown in Example 5. Now, running quarto publish or git push in my local repo, updates my content on both GitHub and GitLab.\n\nExample 5  \ngit remote add lab git@gitlab.com:maptv/maptv.gitlab.io\ngit remote add hub git@github.com:maptv/maptv.github.io\ngit remote set-url --add origin $(git remote get-url lab)\n\nIf you want to have your website hosted on GitHub Pages, you will need to set gh-pages as your source branch in your repo settings. For GitLab Pages, you will need to add a .gitlab-ci.yml file to your repo and update your _quarto.yml file as shown in Example 6 to include .gitlab-ci.yml as a resource in your output directory.\n\nExample 6  \n\n.gitlab-ci.yml_quarto.yml\n\n\n# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/introduction.html#customize-the-default-folder\npages:\n  script: echo \"The site will be deployed to $CI_PAGES_URL\"\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - \".\"\n  publish: \".\"\n  only:\n    - gh-pages\n\n\nauthor:\n  - name: Martin Laptev\n    url: https://maptv.github.io\n\n\n\n\nBy default, GitLab Pages includes a random hash in site URLs. To shorten the URL of my GitLab Pages site to &lt;maptv.gitlab.io&gt;, I had to uncheck Use unique domain under Deploy &gt; Pages in the GitLab sidebar.\nAt this point, we have completed G2 setup and you should be able to run quarto publish gh-pages from your main branch to render your site and deploy it to GitHub and/or GitLab Pages. Deploying with quarto publish at least once is a prerequisite for setting up any of the publishing methods that rely on GitHub Actions, because quarto publish creates a _publish.yml file in the root of your project that is required for publishing via GitHub Actions.\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nIn addition to the steps described above, G3 setup requires that we create a .github/workflows directory and add a YAML file to that directory. Example 7 contains the gh-pages.yml file I use for my own site and the shell code that can used to obtain this file.\n\nExample 7  \n\ncurlgh-pages.yml\n\n\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\ncd .github/workflows\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptv/maptv.github.io/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml\n\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n\nname: Quarto Publish\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n        with:\n          version: '1.4.489'\n          tinytex: true\n\n      - name: Install R\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n          r-version: '4.2.0'\n\n      - name: Install R Dependencies\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2\n        with:\n          cache-version: 1\n\n      - name: Install Python and Dependencies\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n        with:\n          python-version: '3.10'\n          cache: 'pip'\n      - run: pip install jupyter\n      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Push To GitLab\n        env:\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n        run: |\n          echo Starting to push gh-pages branch to GitLab\n          git config user.name \"maptv\"\n          git config user.email \"129316885+maptv@users.noreply.github.com\"\n          git remote set-url origin \"https://oauth2:${token}@gitlab.com/maptv/maptv.gitlab.io\"\n          git push origin gh-pages\n\n\n\n\nThe gh-pages.yml file in Example 7 installs Quarto, the R and Python programming languages, and the packages in the renv.lock and requirements.txt files. If you do not need R and/or Python, you can remove any unnecessary portions of the file.\nTo modify the Python files that are installed by GitHub Actions, you can edit the requirements.txt file in your repo. To update your renv.lock file so that it includes all of the R packages your site requires, run renv::snapshot() in an R session or Rscript -e renv::snapshot() in a shell.\nAfter pushing the gh-pages.yml file, you can visit the Actions tab in your remote repo on GitHub to check the progress of the deployment of your site. If your site did not build successfully, you can go through the logs to try to diagnose the problem.\nI added a “Push to GitLab” step to my gh-pages.yml to make GitHub Actions push my remote gh-pages to GitLab so that my site is kept in sync on both GitHub and GitLab Pages. This required manually creating a token on GitLab and adding it to GitHub, which I accomplished using the GitHub CLI as shown in Example 8.\n\nExample 8  \ngh secret set GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN\n\nAfter the setup described above, I now have two options for publishing my Quarto site: quarto publish and 2) git push. In addition to GitHub and GitLab Pages, both of these options automatically update my site on Netlify via N2.\nTo also automatically update my site on Quarto Pub, I created a separate GitHub Actions workflow by adding another YAML file to the .github/workflows directory in my repo. Example 9 shows my quarto-pub.yml file and the shell code that can be used to obtain it.\n\nExample 9  \n\ncurlquarto-pub.yml\n\n\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\ncd .github/workflows\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maptv/maptv.github.io/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml\n\n\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [pages-build-deployment]\n    types: [completed]\n\nname: Update Quarto Pub\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out main repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Check out _site\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          ref: gh-pages\n          path: _site\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n\n      - name: Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: quarto-pub\n          render: false\n          QUARTO_PUB_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.QUARTO_PUB_AUTH_TOKEN }}\n          GITHUB_USERNAME: maptv\n\n\n\n\nMy quarto-pub.yml file is based on Q2, but it runs upon completion of the pages-build-deployment workflow instead of a push to main. I changed the workflow trigger so that it runs after my GitHub Pages site is built, regardless of whether I triggered the build by running quarto publish gh-pages or pushing to main.\nFigure 3 summarizes all of the steps that occur during my Quarto publishing workflow. This workflow allows me to publish my site on four web hosts every time I run quarto publish gh-pages (G2) or git push (G3)!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G2.-&gt;B[local&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G2.-&gt;C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    B[local&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G2.-&gt;D[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;F[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.G3.-&gt;D[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]\n    A[local&lt;br/&gt;main]-.G3.-&gt;G[GitLab&lt;br/&gt;main]\n    C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.N2.-&gt;E[Netlify]\n    C[GitHub&lt;br/&gt;gh-pages]-.Q2.-&gt;H[Quarto&lt;br/&gt;Pub]\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Quarto publishing workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far I have only noticed one difference between the four web hosts I use for my site: GitHub Pages is the only web host that properly differentiates between internal and external links. All of the other web hosts include the external link icon on all links regardless of whether they target my site or an external site.\nI tried unsuccessfully to solve this issue by setting the link-external-filter property to a regular expression. If you notice a problem with the link-external-icon feature on other web hosts, I suggest switching to GitHub Pages.",

    "text": "Customizing Quarto sites\n\nSite navigation\nOnce your site is built and published, you can make it easier to navigate with a customized navigation bar (navbar) and sidebar, as described in the Quarto documentation. Check out the _quarto.yml files for my site and the Quarto documentation site to see how the navigation components are set up.\nIn my navbar, I added toggle buttons for reader mode and dark mode. The names of the other icons on right side of the navbar are included in the sidebar.\n\n\nHTML blocks\nMy navbar also provides the current date and time in Dec ordinal (deco) format, which counts the years since 1 BC and the days since March 1. Dec is a calendar and time system that I created and use throughout my blog.\nTo add a custom timestamp to the navbar, I put a &lt;script&gt; element that runs time.js in an HTML block in every Quarto markdown (.qmd) file, as shown in Example 10. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel wrote about HTML blocks as part of her A Quarto tip a day project.\n\nExample 10  \n\n*.qmdtime.js\n\n\n```{=html}\n&lt;script src=\"time.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML blocks are useful for running JavaScript code in the context of a single page on your site without affecting the others. I also use HTML blocks to add a &lt;style&gt; element to my .qmd files as a last ditch effort to fine tune the style of my site.\nBefore I resort to the &lt;style&gt; element approach, I try writing CSS in my style.css, light.css, and dark.css files. So far, this approach has been sufficient to make any styling changes I want, but if it every fails, I can use JavaScript to override the default styling provided by Quarto by modifying style attributes, which have the highest specificity in CSS.\n\n\nPost-render script\nI wanted to my blog’s listing page to show dates in the same format as the navbar timestamp. To accomplish this, I used a post-render script written in the Python programming language.\nPre- and post-render scripts are set as project options in the _quarto.yml file in the root of your Quarto project. Example 11 shows the date.py post-render script and how this script is referenced in _quarto.yml.\n\nExample 11  \n\n_quarto.ymldate.py\n\n\nauthor:\n  - name: Martin Laptev\n    url: https://maptv.github.io\ndate-format: x\n\n\n# https://howardhinnant.github.io/date_algorithms.html#days_from_civil\nimport bs4\n\ndef unix2doty(ms):\n    dote = ms / 86400000 + 719468\n    cykl = (\n        dote if dote &gt;= 0\n        else dote - 146096\n    ) // 146097\n    dotc = dote - cykl * 146097\n    yotc = (dotc\n        - dotc // 1460\n        + dotc // 36524\n        - dotc // 146096\n    ) // 365\n    return [\n        int(yotc + cykl * 400),\n        dotc - (yotc * 365\n            + yotc // 4\n            - yotc // 100\n        )\n    ]\n\nwith open(\"_site/list/index.html\") as infile:\n    txt = infile.read()\n    soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(txt, features=\"html.parser\")\nfor div in soup.find_all(\"div\", {\"class\": \"card-file-modified\"}):\n    if \"+\" not in div.text:\n        y, d = unix2doty(int(div.text))\n        div.string.replace_with(f\"{y:&gt;04}+{d.__floor__():&gt;03}\")\nfor div in soup.find_all(\"div\", {\"class\": \"listing-reading-time\"}):\n    if \"min\" in div.text:\n        div.string.replace_with(f\"{(int(div.text.split()[0]) / 1.44).__floor__()} milliday\")\nwith open(\"_site/list/index.html\", \"w\") as outfile:\n    outfile.write(str(soup))\n\n\n\n\nNormally, formatting dates in Quarto is as easy as setting the date-format YAML property. In my case it was more difficult, because I wanted dates based on Dec, the calendar and time system I created, instead of the ubiquitous Gregorian calendar.\nTo facilitate the calculations in date.py, I set date-format to x in my _metadata.yml file so all of the dates would be in millisecond UNIX time and I would not have to deal with Gregorian calendar date formats or time zones. After all of the dates are generated, my date.py script traverses the HTML in the output directory using Beautiful Soup and converts millisecond UNIX time dates into Dec dates (year+day).\n\n\nPandoc filter\nIn addition to customizing dates on the listing page of my blog, I wanted to customize the date format in every blog post. To complete this task, I used a Lua script as a Pandoc filter.\nPandoc is a program that converts documents into practically any format. The “pan” in Pandoc comes from the Ancient Greek word for all. Pandoc strives to convert all document formats, just like Pangea contained all the land and a panacea solves all problems.\nQuarto uses Pandoc to convert markdown files into target format(s) like html or pdf. If the source files contain executable code, Quarto executes the code via one of two computational engines: Jupyter or Knitr. Figure 4 shows the Quarto workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[qmd&lt;br/&gt;ipynb]-.Knitr&lt;br/&gt;Jupyter.-&gt;B((md))-.Pandoc with&lt;br/&gt;Lua filters.-&gt;C(html&lt;br/&gt;pdf&lt;br/&gt;docx&lt;br/&gt;etc.)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Quarto rendering workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s Quarto tip series includes a similar Quarto workflow mermaid diagram and her “Hello, Quarto!” rstudio::conf(2022) keynote with Julia Stewart Lowndes contains truly beautiful Quarto workflow images by Allison Horst: 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nQuarto controls Pandoc, Jupyter, and Knitr in two ways: 1) with arguments passed to the Quarto CLI commands and 2) with YAML key-value pairs in .qmd, .ipynb, or .yml files.\nExample 12 shows how I set up every qmd file to generate the current date in millisecond UNIX time and designated date.lua as a Pandoc filter. Unlike post-render scripts, Pandoc filters are executed during the creation of the output files.\n\nExample 12  \n\n*.qmddate.lua\n\n\ndate: now\ndate-format: x\nfilters: date.lua\n\n\n-- https://howardhinnant.github.io/date_algorithms.html#days_from_civil\nfunction unix2deco(ms)\n  local dote = ms / 86400000 + 719468\n  local cykl = (\n    dote &gt;= 0 and dote\n    or dote - 146096\n  ) // 146097\n  local dotc = dote - cykl * 146097\n  local yotc = (\n    dotc - dotc // 1460\n    + dotc // 36524\n    - dotc // 146096\n  ) // 365\n  return string.format(\n    \"%s+%03d\",\n    math.floor(yotc + cykl * 400),\n    math.floor(dotc - (yotc * 365\n      + yotc // 4\n      - yotc // 100)))\nend\n\nlocal function to_decalendar(date)\n  local date = pandoc.utils.stringify(date)\n  local unix = date:match(\"(%d+)\")\n  return date:gsub(unix, unix2deco(unix))\nend\n\nfunction Meta(m)\n  m.date = to_decalendar(m.date)\n  return m\nend\n\n\n\n\nAll three of the customizations I described above convert millisecond UNIX time into a custom date format, but you can adapt these approaches to make all sorts of edits to your Quarto site. HTML blocks can run JavaScript which excels at making content dynamic and interactive, pre- and post-render scripts can be in any programming language, while Pandoc filters are written in Lua and modify output during rendering.\nComing up next on my blog is a post that Observable graphics.
