    "text": "Publishing method overview\nOnce you are done setting up your computer and creating the Quarto website template, you can make your site publicly available on the internet using one of the many available publishing services. To explore and assess different publishing workflows and free website hosting options, I set up my personal website on four different web hosts: Quarto Pub, Netlify, GitHub Pages, and GitLab Pages.\nTable 1 uses a Code derived from numbered lists in the Quarto publishing documentation to identify different publishing strategies that I discuss in this blog post. All of the approaches targeting [GitHub Pages] can be adapted to work for GitLab Pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nHost\nRender\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nQ1\nQuarto\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nQ2\nQuarto\nRemote\npush\n\n\nN1\nNetlify\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nN2\nNetlify\nLocal\npush\n\n\nN3\nNetlify\nRemote\npush\n\n\nG1\nGitHub\nLocal\npush\n\n\nG2\nGitHub\nLocal\npublish\n\n\nG3\nGitHub\nRemote\npush\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Quarto website publishing methods\n\n\n\nThe main method to deploy Quarto sites is the quarto publish shell command, which can render and deploy your site in one fell swoop and then open it a browser so you can view the latest version. The Q1, N1, and G2 publishing methods in Table 1 all use quarto publish.\nIf you do not plan to use the Git version control system or the advanced features offered by GitHub, GitLab, or Netlify, then I recommend deploying your site to Quarto Pub by running quarto publish quarto-pub (Q1 in Table 1).\nLike Q1, N1 is a deployment method that does not require Git and makes it possible to deploy our site with a single shell command: quarto publish netlify. The advantage of N1 over Q1 is that we can gain access to the advanced web hosting features offered by Netlify.\nThe first publishing method I tried for my personal site was G1, which requires the use of Git to push all website files to a Git provider like GitHub or GitLab. After I set up GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, and Netlify (N2), I could update my website on all 3 of these web hosts just by going through the standard Git workflow shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n   A[working&lt;br/&gt;directory]-.git&lt;br/&gt;add.-&gt;B[/staging&lt;br/&gt;area/]-.git&lt;br/&gt;commit.-&gt;C(local&lt;br/&gt;repo)-.git&lt;br/&gt;push.-&gt;D(remote&lt;br/&gt;repo)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Quarto workflow\n\n\n\n\n\nG1 is convenient for experienced Git users like me, but leads to messy commits that contain changes to both source and output files. To address this issue, I switched to G2 by adding the quarto publish to my publishing workflow. With G2, I can track changes to my source files on my main branch and publish my output files from my gh-pages branch.\nN2 can be combined with G1, G2, and any other publishing method that uses Git. When I run quarto publish gh-pages, Quarto renders my site into my output directory, copies the output directory contents to the gh-pages branch of my local repo, and then commits and pushes the changes to my remote repos on GitHub and GitLab, which then triggers Netlify to build my site from the gh-pages branch.\nThe only disadvantage of G2 is that there are many commands to run, because running quarto publish gh-pages only updates the output files on my gh-pages and I still have run the git shell commands shown in Figure 1 to update the source files on my main branch. To make it easier to make incremental changes to my website and frequently release new content, I combined all of the G2 shell commands with a shell alias like the one shown in Example 5.\n\nExample 2  \nalias qp='(\nquarto publish --no-prompt gh-pages;\ngit add --all;\ngit commit -m 'Edit source files';\ngit push;\n)'\n\nYou can add aliases to a shell configuration file like .bashrc or .zshrc on your computer to shorten commands or combine any sequence of commands into one step. The qp alias in my .zshrc in my setup repo is much more sophisticated than the alias in Example 5, because it allows me to enter a free-form commit message directly on the command line without quotes, e.g. qp edit first blog.\nIf you decide to use an alias like my qp alias, please exercise extreme caution as any un-escaped or un-quoted metacharacters may yield surprising effects instead of being included verbatim in the commit message. For example, qp * will list the contents of the current directory in the commit message in place of the asterisk!\nTo summarize the Quarto publishing methods I discussed so far, Q1 and N1 are easy to configure and use, N2 automatically builds sites from Git repos, G1 is not recommended because it pollutes commits with output file changes, and G2 is more difficult to set up and use but provides clean commits and a nice separation of source and output files. All of these publishing methods require us to generate output files locally by rendering our source files.\nIn contrast, Q2, G3, and N3 require the most configuration but make it possible to skip local rendering in favor of relying on GitHub Actions to handle all of the necessary steps. My recommendation is to first get used to G2 before trying to use GitHub Actions or any other continuous integration systems in your publishing workflow.\nIn Section 1.3, I will walk through the setup for G2 and G3 from scratch. Along the way, I will share many practical tips for publishing Quarto websites and general advice for working with Git that you apply to any project.",

    "section": "GitHub Pages setup",
    "text": "GitHub Pages setup\nBefore you can publish your site on GitHub or GitLab Pages, you need a GitHub or GitLab account and a repo like my maptv.github.io and maptv.gitlab.io repos. Each of these repos has a default branch, which by default is called main, and another branch that must be called gh-pages.\nYou can create the repo and the gh-pages branch using the web interface of https://github.com or https://gitlab.com in your browser, but the best way to start a new project is using the command line interface (CLI) for GitHub or GitLab in your terminal. First, run gh auth login or glab auth login and follow the prompts to authenticate via your web browser or with an authentication token.\nAfter authentication, you can run the code in either of the code chunks in Example 3 to set up your local and remote repos.\n\nExample 3  \ngh repo create SITENAME --add-readme --clone --public\nglab repo create SITENAME --readme\n\nNext, clone the repo you created using the shell commands like git clone, gh repo clone, or glab repo clone, a Git graphical user interface (GUI) like GitHub Desktop, or the Git interface of a code editor such as Visual Studio Code or RStudio.\nCloning an empty repo may seem odd, but in my experience this is the easiest way to set up a repo. Inside your cloned repo, you can run quarto create project website to generate the starter template and then immediately run quarto publish gh-pages.\nWhen I run quarto publish --no-prompt --no-browser gh-pages, Quarto renders my site into my output directory (docs), copies the output directory contents to the gh-pages branchof my local repository (repo), and then commits and pushes the changes to my remote repositories (repos) on GitHub and GitLab.\nTo get quarto publish gh-pages to work with both GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages, I followed the Quarto documentation on publishing to GitHub Pages, added a second origin URL to my local repo using the git remote shell commands, created a GitLab repo called maptv.gitlab.io with a gh-pages branch, created a .gitlab-ci.yml file, and modified my _quarto.yml, as shown in Example 6.\n\nExample 4  \ngit remote add lab git@gitlab.com:maptv/maptv.gitlab.io\ngit remote add hub git@github.com:maptv/maptv.github.io\ngit remote set-url --add origin $(git remote get-url lab)\n# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/introduction.html#customize-the-default-folder\npages:\n  script: echo \"The site will be deployed to $CI_PAGES_URL\"\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - \".\"\n  publish: \".\"\n  only:\n    - gh-pages\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n  resources: .gitlab-ci.yml\n\nYou can also configure Netlify to deploy your site based on the latest commit in your repo on either GitHub or GitLab, by selecting Site configuration, Build & deploy, Link repository, choosing between Deploy with GitHub or Deploy with GitLab, and then specifying the repo and branch. This approach works similar to quarto publish netlify but has the added benefit of using the Git version control system behind the scenes to track changes in the content.\nWith the settings described above, running quarto publish gh-pages updates my site on GitHub, GitLab, and Netlify. To also deploy to my site to Quarto Pub, I still need to run quarto publish quarto-pub.\nIf your deployment workflow includes multiple steps, you can use a shell alias to combine all of the steps into one. Example 5 shows a shell alias called qp that deploys a site first to GitHub Pages and then to Quarto Pub.\n\nExample 5  \nalias qp='(\nquarto publish --no-prompt --no-browser gh-pages;\nquarto publish --no-prompt --no-browser --no-render quarto-pub;\n)'\n\nOf these four options, only GitLab Pages is not supported by the command and only Quarto Pub is not compatible with the If you do not plan to use Git, I recommend deploying your site to Quarto Pubs with the quarto publish command. On the other hand, if you are going to use Git to push your content to a GitHub or GitLab Pages-enabled repository, you have no need for the quarto publish.\ndoes not have a gives you no control over the commit message for each update, no commit messages If you use quarto publish with GitHub Pages, the only disadvantages are that you must select your source branch to be gh-pages\nand/or the Git version control workflow shown in Figure 1.\nNetlify git workflow setup: Site configuration &gt; Build & deploy &gt; Link repository &gt; Deploy with GitHub|GitLab, and then select the repo and branch. GitLab Pages git workflow setup: - add .gitlab-ci.yml to root of your git repo and push - uncheck Use unique domain under Deploy &gt; Pages in the GitLab sidebar to have a shorter URL.\ncontrol system, you may prefer to host your site on Quarto Pubs or Netlify. On the other hand, if you are are already using git and hosting your site on GitHub or GitLab Pages, you have no need for the quarto publish.\nQuarto publishing documentation\nIn my experience, the quarto publish works Publishing to GitHub Pages with quarto publish requires setting up your site to be built from a gh-pages branch instead of main, which for me was a dealbreaker.\nIf you want to host your site on Quarto Pub, Netlify, or GitHub Pages, the Quarto publishing documentation is all you need. ::: {.callout-warning} The rest of this section focuses on GitLab Pages. Quarto does not officially supported by GitLab Pages, so if you are just starting out, you should choose one of the other options and skip down to Section 2. :::\nThe Quarto documentation does not discuss GitLab Pages, but you can follow the GitHub Pages instructions and then add a .gitlab-ci.yml file, like the one below, to the Git (repo) containing your Quarto-rendered site. After pushing to a GitLab remote repo,\n# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/introduction.html#customize-the-default-folder\npages:\n  script: echo \"The site will be deployed to $CI_PAGES_URL\"\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - \".\"\n  publish: \".\"\n  only:\n    - gh-pages\nIf your site is published on Quarto Pub, Netlify, or GitHub Pages, you can use the quarto publish command to update it. The quarto publish command does not work for GitLab Pages, but GitHub and GitLab Pages-hosted sites can be updated using the standard Git workflow shown in Figure 1.\nTo make it easier to maintain my site on both GitHub and GitLab Pages, I set up my local repo cloned to have two origin remote URLs using the code in Example 6. Now, whenever I run git push in my local repo, Git pushes my updates to both GitHub and GitLab.\n\nExample 6  \ngit remote add lab git@gitlab.com:maptv/maptv.gitlab.io\ngit remote add hub git@github.com:maptv/maptv.github.io\ngit remote set-url --add origin $(git remote get-url lab)\n\nTo make the git workflow displayed in Figure 1 easier, I use the alias shown in Example 7 to combine the git add, commit, and push commands into one step. This alias allows me to provide a that describes each update directly on the\n\nExample 7  \nalias aacmp='(\n    \"func() { git add --all && git commit --message\n    \\\"$(echo '${*:-Changed files: $(echo $(git status --porcelain\n    | grep -v \"?\" | cut -c4- | tr \"\\n\" \" \"))}')\\\"\n    && git push; }; func\"\n)'\n\nExample 5 contains an analogous shell alias for quarto publish that updates site content on Quarto Pub, Netlify, and GitHub Pages. For more shell aliases, check out my .zshrc in my setup repo.\nFor more information on the git, the tool used by 93% of software developers worldwide, according to survey results published by StackOverflow on 2022+314, take a look at the “GitHub for supporting, reusing, contributing, and failing safely” post by Allison Horst and Julie Lowndes on the Openscapes blog.

    "text": "Decalendar1 is a decimal calendar🗓️system and Declock2 is a decimal timekeeping⏳system. Instead of months, weeks, hours, minutes, and seconds, Decalendar and Declock use a number called the day-of-the-year (doty)3. Figure 1 displays the current doty () as a bar chart. The integer part of the doty is the Decalendar date4 () and the fractional part is the Declock time5 ().\nThe top two bars in Figure 1 (旬 and 日) show the two components of the Decalendar date (): the dek6 () and the day-of-the-dek7 (). A dek is a group of 10 days that fulfills the role of months and weeks in Decalendar. Therefore, the dek and the day-of-the-dek (dotd) in Decalendar dates are analogous to the month and day-of-the-month (dotm) in calendar dates (mm-dd) and the week and day-of-the-week (dotw) in week dates (Www-d).\nThe bottom three bars in Figure 1 (%, ‰, and ♫) show components of the Declock time (): cents8 (), mils9 (), and beats10 (). A cent is 1% of the day, which is a little less than a quarter hour. A mil (‰) is a tenth of a cent, which is close to a minute and a half. A beat is 1% of a mil, which is almost as long as a second, and can be thought of as a heart❤️beat or musical🎵beat with a constant rate or tempo of 69.4̅ beats per minute.

    "text": "Decalendar1 is a decimal calendar🗓️system and Declock2 is a decimal timekeeping⏳system. Instead of months, weeks, hours, minutes, and seconds, Decalendar and Declock use a number called the day-of-the-year (doty)3. Figure 1 displays the current doty () as a bar chart. The integer part of the doty is the Decalendar date4 () and the fractional part is the Declock time5 ().\nThe top two bars in Figure 1 (旬 and 日) show the two components of the Decalendar date (): the dek6 () and the day-of-the-dek7 (). A dek is a group of 10 days that fulfills the role of months and weeks in Decalendar. Therefore, the dek and the day-of-the-dek (dotd) in Decalendar dates are analogous to the month and day-of-the-month (dotm) in calendar dates (mm-dd) and the week and day-of-the-week (dotw) in week dates (Www-d).\nThe bottom three bars in Figure 1 (%, ‰, and ♫) show components of the Declock time (): cents8 (), mils9 (), and beats10 (). A cent is 1% of the day, which is a little less than a quarter hour. A mil (‰) is a tenth of a cent, which is close to a minute and a half. A beat is 1% of a mil, which is almost as long as a second, and can be thought of as a heart❤️beat or musical🎵beat with a constant rate or tempo of 69.4̅ beats per minute.

    "text": "Year\nDoty dates (day) and timestamps (day.stamp) do not include years and thus can be reused from year to year. When a doty is combined with a year, it forms a Decalendar ordinal12 (deco) and represents a specific date (year+day) or time (year+day.stamp) in a specific year, instead of a date (day) or time (day.stamp) that occurs every year or every leap year. Using the Observable datetime input in Example 2, you can select a year, month, dotm, hour, and minute to see the equivalent 1) deco timestamp (year+day.clock) and 2) year date (year.yyy) in List 2. For comparison, the current deco timestamp is .\n\nExample 2  \n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof inputDatetime = Inputs.datetime({label: \"date\", value: \"1970-01-01T00:00\"})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList 2: Date and time conversion\n\n\n\n\nIn Example 3, you can enter numeric year and doty values or type in a free-form deco to see the resulting 1) ISO 8601 timestamp (year-mm-ddThh:mm:ss) and 2) year date in List 3. Example 3 also has a Play▶️button in that cycles from Day 0 to Day 365 of Year 1969. The cycle goes up to Day 0 of Year 1970, because Year 1969 is a common year and does not have a Day 365.\nInteracting with the number inputs in Example 3, standardizes the deco in the text input to ensure years are integers and doty values are positive numbers below 366. Nevertheless, all of the inputs in Example 3 support negative and fractional year and doty values. Negative doty values shift dates backward in time from the start of a given year into a previous year. Similarly, negative years shift dates backward starting from Year 0, which is 1 BCE (Before the Common Era).\n\nExample 3  \n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof yd = Inputs.form([\n  Inputs.number({label: \"year\", value: \"1969\"}),\n  Inputs.number({label: \"doty\", value: \"306\"})\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof decoOutput = transformInput(\n  Inputs.text({label: \"deco\", placeholder: \"year+day.ddd\", value: \"1969+306\"}),\n  {bind: viewof yd, transform: doty2deco, invert: deco2doty});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof scrubberDeco = Scrubber(numbers, {autoplay: false, alternate: true, delay: 86.4, loopDelay: 864})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList 3: Deco timestamp conversion",

    "text": "Dek\nAs mentioned in Section 0.1, deks function as both months and weeks in Decalendar. A dek consists of 2 groups of 5 days called pents13. Each pent can follow a sequence of workdays and restdays called a pently schedule14. fig-schedules compares the typical weekly schedule and the Schedule 3 pently schedule. Like other pently schedules, Schedule 3 is named after the number of workdays it contains. The 3 workdays in Schedule 3 are followed by a 2-day pentend, the Decalender equivalent of a weekend.\nUnlike Schedule 3 and the other pently schedules, the weekly schedule is asymmetric and divides up workdays into proportions that are easier to express as fractions: 3/8 (.375), 1/3 (.3̅), and 7/24 (0.2916̅). In contrast, pently schedules divides each workday into simple, symmetrical proportions that are never repeating decimal numbers. The Schedule 3 workday is longer the typical 9-to-5, but the longer workday is compensated by more frequent restdays.\nExample 4 provides the opportunity to explore all four of the pently schedules. Schedule 3 is the default pently schedule, and should be followed unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise. Despite having different numbers of workdays, all pently schedules keep the amount of spent at work constant at 1.2 days (120 cents) per pent. Every pently schedule also splits up workdays symmetrically so that the time before work is equal to the time after work. You can select which schedule to view in Example 4 using the Observable radio inputs.\nYou can also use the interval sliders to create a custom schedule and the Download⬇️button to obtain the schedule data. Each interval is summarized by a Declock slice shown next to its slider. Decalendar and Declock slices are inspired by array slicing in computer programming and are used to represent date and time intervals. The slice that summarizes the Schedule 3 workday is .3:.7, where .3 (7.2 hours) is the start and .7 (16.8 hours) is the stop.\n\nExample 4  \n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof intervals = Inputs.form([\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [.3, .7], label: '0 or 5', width: 250, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}:${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [.3, .7], label: '1 or 6', width: 250, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}:${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [.3, .7], label: '2 or 7', width: 250, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}:${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [0, 0], label: '3 or 8', width: 250, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}:${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n  interval([0, 1], {step: .01, value: [0, 0], label: '4 or 9', width: 250, format: ([start, end]) =&gt; start === end ? \"\" : `${formatDecimal(start)}:${formatDecimal(end)}`}),\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof schedule = Inputs.radio([2, 3, 4, 5], {label: \"sched.\", value: 3})\n\nviewof filename = Inputs.text({label: \"name\", placeholder: \"Enter the filename\", value: `schedule${schedule}.csv`})\n\nbutton(durations, filename)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n// https://observablehq.com/@dec/pent\nPlot.plot({\n  className: \"schedule-explorer\",\n  x: {label: null},\n  color: {scheme: \"Set1\", legend: \"swatches\", reverse: true},\n  y: {label: null, domain: [1, 0]},\n  marks: [\n  Plot.barY(durations, {x: \"label\", y: \"duration\", fill: \"group\"}),\n  Plot.textY(\n      durations,\n      Plot.stackY(\n        Plot.groupX(\n          { y: \"first\", text: \"first\" },\n          {\n            x: \"label\",\n            z: \"group\",\n            y: \"duration\",\n            text: (d) =&gt; (d.duration &lt; .0001 ? null : formatDecimal(d.duration)),\n            fill: \"white\",\n            stroke: \"black\",\n            fontSize: 36,\n          }\n        )\n      )\n    ),\n  ]})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Pently schedule explorer\n\n\n\n\n\nSlices can be used to select Declock time intervals, as in Example 4 above, or Decalendar date intervals, as in Example 5 below. Decalendar date intervals can represent events take place over multiple days. In addition to slices, Decalendar and Declock intervals can also be chosen using spreads. Use the Observable button and checkbox inputs in Example 5 to display different dotd combinations in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows dates selected by a slice in blue, dates selected by a spread in orange, dates selected by both in green, and dates selected by neither in gray.\nThe Example 5 button and checkbox inputs will modify the associated slice and spread text and numeric inputs as needed to select the desired days-of-the-dek. The numeric inputs for slices are the start🎬index, the stop🛑index, and the step👣size, which are separated by colons (start:stop:step) when combined into a slice. Similarly, the numeric inputs for spreads are the start🎬or🛑stop index, the span🪽size, the split size, and the space size, which are typically delimited by greater-than signs (start&gt;span&gt;split&gt;space) or a mix of greater-than and less-than signs (stop&lt;span&gt;split&gt;space).\nThe numeric inputs in Example 5 cannot capture the full power of spreads and slices, because slices can have any number of steps and, likewise, spreads can have any number of alternating split and space sizes. We can select all even or odd days-of-the-dek using a slice with a single step (::2 or 1::2) or a spread with one split-space pair (&gt;&gt;&gt;1 or 1&gt;&gt;&gt;1). More complex patterns, such as prime or composite days-of-the-dek, require multiple step sizes for slices (2:::2:2:5 or 4::2:2::5) or multiple split-space pairs (2&gt;&gt;2&gt;1&gt;&gt;1&gt;&gt;4 or 4&gt;&gt;&gt;1&gt;&gt;1&gt;2&gt;4).\n\nExample 5  \n\n\nCode\nviewof sliceDotd = Inputs.checkbox([...Array(10).keys()], {label: \"slice\", value: [1, 6]})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof spreadDotd = Inputs.checkbox([...Array(10).keys()], {label: \"spread\", value: [1, 6]})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof togglePlot = Inputs.button([\n  [invertDotd ? \"None\" : \"All\", value =&gt; [...Array(10).keys()]],\n  [invertDotd ? \"Even\" : \"Odd\", value =&gt; [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]],\n  [invertDotd ? html`&lt;s&gt;Prime&lt;/s&gt;` : \"Prime\", value =&gt; [2, 3, 5, 7]],\n  [invertDotd ? html`&lt;s&gt;Composite&lt;/s&gt;` : \"Composite\", value =&gt; [4, 6, 8, 9]],\n  [invertDotd ? html`&lt;s&gt;Schedule2&lt;/s&gt;` : \"Schedule2\", value =&gt; [0, 1, 5, 6]],\n  [invertDotd ? html`&lt;s&gt;Schedule3&lt;/s&gt;` : \"Schedule3\", value =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7]],\n  [invertDotd ? html`&lt;s&gt;Schedule4&lt;/s&gt;` : \"Schedule4\", value =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]],\n], {value: [], label: \"select\"})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof invertDotd = Inputs.toggle({label: \"invert\"})\nviewof sliceOrSpread = toggleSwitch({textOn: invertDotd ? \"Spread\" : 'Slice' , textOff: invertDotd ? \"Slice\" : 'Spread'})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof sliceInputs = Inputs.form([\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"start\", value: 1, placeholder: \"Enter start index\"}),\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"stop\", value: 366, placeholder: \"Enter stop index\"}),\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"step\", value: 5, placeholder: \"Enter step size\"}),\n])\nviewof sliceString = transformInput(\n  Inputs.text({label: \"slice\", placeholder: \"Enter slice string\", value: \"0:366\"}),\n{bind: viewof sliceInputs, transform: encodeSlice, invert: decodeSlice});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof spreadInputs = Inputs.form([\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"start\", value: 0, placeholder: \"Enter start index\"}),\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"span\", value: 366, placeholder: \"Enter span size\"}),\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"split\", value: 3, placeholder: \"Enter split size\"}),\n    Inputs.number([-366, 366], {step: 1, label: \"space\", value: 2, placeholder: \"Enter space size\"}),\n])\nviewof spreadString = transformInput(\n  Inputs.text({label: \"spread\", placeholder: \"Enter spread string\", value: \"0&gt;366&gt;3&gt;2\"}),\n{bind: viewof spreadInputs, transform: encodeSpread, invert: decodeSpread});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n// https://observablehq.com/@dec/dotd\nPlot.plot({\n  className: \"date-selector\",\n  padding: 0,\n  x: {axis: \"top\", label: null, type: \"band\"},\n  y: {label: null, type: \"band\"},\n  marks: [\n    Plot.cell(dates, {x: d =&gt; d[2], y: d =&gt; d.slice(0, 2), fill: d =&gt;\n      sliceArray.includes(d) && spreadArray.includes(d) ? \"green\" :\n      sliceArray.includes(d) && !spreadArray.includes(d) ? \"blue\" :\n      !sliceArray.includes(d) && spreadArray.includes(d) ? \"orange\" : \"grey\",\n      inset: 0.5}),\n    Plot.text(dates, {\n    x: d =&gt; d[2],\n    y: d =&gt; d.slice(0, 2),\n    fill: \"white\",\n    stroke: \"black\",\n    fontSize: 20})\n  ]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Decalendar date selector",
