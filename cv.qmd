## Summary

My goal is to train and lead the next generation of data scientists to integrate substantive expertise from diverse fields with machine intelligence.
Through research and teaching, I am constantly improving my ability to obtain, tidy, explore, transform, visualize, model, and communicate data.
My preferred tools are JavaScript, Python, and R, open source programming languages kept on the cutting edge by their energetic communities.
In addition to their utility in common data science tasks, these languages serve as accessible interfaces to deep learning libraries like TensorFlow.
I aim to leverage my background in science and education to help shape the future of data science and deliver on the promise of machine learning
