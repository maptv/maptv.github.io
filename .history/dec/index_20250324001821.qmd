# Dec {.hiddenheading}

This section of my website focuses on Dec, a [measurement system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_units_of_measurement#:~:text=a%20collection%20of%20units%20of%20measurement%20and%20rules%20relating%20them%20to%20each%20other) that [I](https://maptv.github.io) created. All Dec measurements are based on [turns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_%28angle%29#:~:text=a%20unit%20of%20plane%20angle%20measurement%20equal%20to%202%CF%80%C2%A0radians%2C%20360%C2%A0degrees) (t). When measuring [angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle#:~:text=the%20figure%20formed%20by%20two%20rays)📐, t represents a full⭕️circle and equals 2$\pi$ ([$\underline\tau$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_%28angle%29#:~:text=the%20Greek%20letter,to%20one%20turn)) [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian#:~:text=the%20unit%20of%20angle%20in%20the%20International%20System%20of%20Units) (rad) or 360 [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#:~:text=a%20measurement%20of%20a%20plane%20angle%20in%20which%20one%20full%20rotation%20is%20360%20degrees) (°). Dec measures distance📏in turns called [taurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)#Tau_proposals:~:text=%E2%81%A0%20turn-,Circumference%20of%20a%20circle,-%F0%9D%90%B6) (c) and tracks time⏳with two other types of turns: years (y) and days (d).

The three turn types that Dec uses for distance📏and time⏳measurement are all approximations of physical attributes of the Earth🌍: c $\approx$ the [circumference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_circumference#:~:text=the%20distance%20around%20Earth) of the Earth🌎, y $\approx$ the duration of [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit#:~:text=From%20a%20vantage%20point%20above%20the%20north%20pole%20of%20either%20the%20Sun%20or%20Earth%2C%20Earth%20would%20appear%20to%20revolve%20in%20a%20counterclockwise%20direction%20around%20the%20Sun) of the Earth🌏around the Sun☀️, and d $\approx$ the duration of [rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation#:~:text=the%20rotation%20of%20planet%20Earth%20around%20its%20own%20axis) of the Earth🌍on its [axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#:~:text=the%20imaginary%20line%20that%20passes%20through%20both%20the%20north%20pole%20and%20south%20pole). Notably, $\text c\over\text d$ = [v = ωr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity#:~:text=linear%20velocity%20is%20the%20radius%20times%20the%20angular%20velocity) $\approx$ the speed of the rotation of Earth🌎at the [Equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator#:~:text=the%20circle%20of%20latitude%20that%20divides%20Earth%20into%20the%20Northern%20and%20Southern%20hemispheres).

The table below⬇️provides the current [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude#:~:text=a%20geographic%20coordinate%20that%20specifies%20the%20east%2Dwest%20position%20of%20a%20point%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20the%20Earth) ([$\lambda$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude#:~:text=denoted%20by%20the%20Greek%20letter%20lambda)) in [milli[parallels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_latitude#:~:text=an%20abstract%20east%E2%80%93west%20small%20circle%20connecting%20all%20locations%20around%20Earth%20(ignoring%20elevation)%20at%20a%20given%20latitude%20coordinate%20line)]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a circle of longitude"} (m$\lambda$) and [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#:~:text=a%20geographic%20coordinate%20that%20specifies%20the%20north%2Dsouth%20position%20of%20a%20point%20on%20the%20surface%20of%20the%20Earth) ([$\phi$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#:~:text=denoted%20by%20the%20Greek%20lower%2Dcase%20letter%20phi)) in [milli[meridians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography)#:~:text=the%20locus%20connecting%20points%20of%20equal%20longitude)]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a circle of latitude"} (m$\phi$) of Points [0]{.point0} and [1]{.point1} on the map🗺️beneath the table. By default, [Point 0]{.point0} is at [800]{.point0} m$\lambda$ and [0]{.point0} m$\phi$, which is near the [Galápagos🏝️archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands#:~:text=an%20archipelago%20of%20volcanic%20islands%20in%20the%20Eastern%20Pacific) of Ecuador🇪🇨, and [Point 1]{.point1} is at [800]{.point1} m$\lambda$ and [100]{.point1} m$\phi$, which is in the United States🇺🇸city of [Memphis, Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee#:~:text=a%20city%20in%20the%20U.S.%20state%20of%20Tennessee).

In the table, the geographic coordinates of each point are followed by the [course](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_(navigation)#:~:text=the%20cardinal%20direction%20in%20which%20the%20craft%20is%20to%20be%20steered) ([$\alpha$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth#:~:text=%20azimuth%20is%20usually%20denoted%20alpha)) in [milli[windroses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_rose#:~:text=a%20polar%20diagram%20displaying%20the%20orientation%20of%20the%20cardinal%20directions)]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a compass rose"} (m$\alpha$) we would need to maintain to travel🧳the shortest distance📏to the other point on the map🗺️. The default courses in m$\alpha$ are [0]{.point0} (North) from [Point 0]{.point0} to [Point 1]{.point1} and [500]{.point1} (South) from [Point 1]{.point1} to [Point 0]{.point0}. By default, the points are 100 [millitaurs]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a taur"} (mc) apart.

Next to the "Reset" button, there are [toggle](https://observablehq.com/framework/inputs/toggle)✅inputs that add country borders, a grid of Dec [graticules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graticule_(cartography)#:~:text=a%20graphical%20depiction%20of%20a%20coordinate%20system%20as%20a%20grid%20of%20lines), [solar terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(solar)#:~:text=a%20moving%20line%20that%20divides%20the%20daylit%20side%20and%20the%20dark%20night%20side%20of%20a%20planetary%20body) shading, a yellow🟡dot denoting where the Sun☀️is directly overhead (\${Math.floor(long2turn(sun[0]))} m$\lambda$, \${Math.floor(lati2turn(sun[1]))} m$\phi$), and [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time#:~:text=the%20primary%20time%20standard%20globally%20used%20to%20regulate%20clocks%20and%20time) time zones.

The length of a meridian (L$_\phi$) is always near c: L$_\phi$ $\approx$ c. In contrast, the length of a parallel (L$_\lambda$) [varies by latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude#Length_of_a_degree_of_longitude:~:text=depends%20only%20on%20the%20radius%20of%20a%20circle%20of%20latitude) ($\phi$).

An airplane✈️flying at 500 [milliomegars]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of the circumference of Earth"} (mv), half the equatorial speed of the rotation of Earth🌏on its axis, could travel🧳the 100 mc between the default positions📍of Points [0]{.point0} and [1]{.point1} in 200 [millidays]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a day"} (md). To get the time in days (d) required to travel🧳between two points, we divide the distance📏in mc by the speed in mv: \${distance_mtaur} mc &divide; \${travelspeed} mv = \${(distance_mtaur / travelspeed).toFixed(3)} d.

The [color🎨wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel#:~:text=an%20abstract%20illustrative%20organization%20of%20color%20hues%20around%20a%20circle) [compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass#:~:text=a%20device%20that%20shows%20the%20cardinal%20directions%20used%20for%20navigation%20and%20geographic%20orientation)🧭above⬆️indicates both a [hue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue#:~:text=an%20angular%20position%20around%20a%20central%20or%20neutral%20point%20or%20axis%20on%20a%20color%20space%20coordinate%20diagram) and a [direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction). To rotate🔄the color🎨wheel compass🧭, use the [Observable](https://observablehq.com) hue [bar](https://observablehq.com/@paavanb/progressive-color-picker)📊and range🎚️inputs beneath it or change the course from [Point 0]{.point0} to [Point 1]{.point1} on the map🗺️. The table above⬆️shows the currently indicated direction (top row) and the [cardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction#:~:text=north%2C%20south%2C%20east%2C%20and%20west) and [intercardinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction#:~:text=northeast%20(NE)%2C%20southeast%20(SE)%2C%20southwest%20(SW)%2C%20and%20northwest%20(NW)) directions.

The range🎚️inputs beneath the color🎨wheel compass🧭represent a hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) triplet that specifies a color with three [milliturn]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a thousandth of a turn"} (mt) values. We can convert the hue mt value into compass🧭degrees (c°) and [HSL and HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#:~:text=the%20two%20most%20common%20cylindrical%2Dcoordinate%20representations%20of%20points%20in%20an%20RGB%20color%20model) hue degrees (h°). We can also translate an HSL triplet into an HSV, [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model#:~:text=an%20additive%20color%20model), or [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet:~:text=hexadecimal%20number%20used%20in%20HTML%2C%20CSS%2C%20SVG%2C%20and%20other%20computing%20applications%20to%20represent%20colors) (hex) triplet.

Color🎨can provide a general sense of angular📐[measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle#:~:text=The%20magnitude%20of%20an%20angle), regardless of the [metric prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix#:~:text=a%20unit%20prefix%20that%20precedes%20a%20basic%20unit%20of%20measure%20to%20indicate%20a%20multiple%20or%20submultiple%20of%20the%20unit) or [units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle#Units) we use. Therefore, we can reuse♻️colors🎨across many different contexts. In any context, starting points are red: North (\${rainbowNort} m$\alpha$), [Meridian 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18th_meridian_west#:~:text=a%20line%20of%20longitude%20that%20extends%20from%20the%20North%20Pole%20across%20the%20Arctic%20Ocean%2C%20Greenland%2C%20Iceland%2C%20the%20Atlantic%20Ocean%2C%20the%20Canary%20Islands%2C%20the%20Southern%20Ocean%2C%20and%20Antarctica%20to%20the%20South%20Pole) (\${rainbowMer0} m$\lambda$), and midnight (\${rainbowMidN} md); midpoints are cyan: South (\${rainbowSout} m$\alpha$), [Meridian 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/162nd_meridian_east#:~:text=a%20line%20of%20longitude%20that%20extends%20from%20the%20North%20Pole%20across%20the%20Arctic%20Ocean%2C%20Asia%2C%20the%20Pacific%20Ocean%2C%20the%20Southern%20Ocean%2C%20and%20Antarctica%20to%20the%20South%20Pole) (\${rainbowMer5} ml), and noon (\${rainbowNoon} md).

Apart from m$\alpha$, m$\lambda$, and md, we can apply color🎨labels🏷️based on [milliyears]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a year"} (my) and [millimillennia]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="thousandths of a millennium"} (mk). Every year (y) starts on [Day 0]{.underline .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="March 1"} (\${rainbowDay0} my). The midyear point (\${rainbowMidY} my) is noon of [Day 182]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="August 30"} in common years and midnight of [Day 183]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="August 31"} in leap years. Every millennium (k) starts with Year 0 (\${rainbowY000} mk) and has Year 500 (\${rainbowY500} mk) as its midpoint.

The Equator, also known as Parallel 0, is the midpoint between the South (\${rainbowSpol} m$\phi$) and North (\${rainbowNpol} m$\phi$) Pole. When the “Grid” toggle✅input is enabled, Parallels [-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_parallel_south#:~:text=a%20circle%20of%20latitude%20that%20is%2072%20degrees%20south%20of%20the%20Earth's%20equatorial%20plane%20in%20the%20Antarctic) (\${rainbowN200} m$\phi$), [-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36th_parallel_south#:~:text=a%20circle%20of%20latitude%20that%20is%2036%20degrees%20south%20of%20the%20Earth's%20equatorial%20plane) (\${rainbowN100} m$\phi$), 0 (\${rainbowEqua} m$\phi$), [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36th_parallel_north#:~:text=a%20circle%20of%20latitude%20that%20is%2036%20degrees%20north%20of%20the%20Earth's%20equatorial%20plane) (\${rainbowP100} m$\phi$), and [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_parallel_north#:~:text=a%20circle%20of%20latitude%20that%20is%2072%20degrees%20north%20of%20the%20Earth's%20equatorial%20plane%2C%20in%20the%20Arctic) (\${rainbowP200} m$\phi$) are shown on the map🗺️above⬆️along with the ten major meridians that divide the Earth🌍into the ten Dec time zones.

Not shown on the map are the four [major parallels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_latitude#:~:text=mark%20the%20divisions%20between%20the%20five%20principal%20geographical%20zones) that depend on the [axial tilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#Earth:~:text=the%20angle%20between%20the%20ecliptic%20and%20the%20celestial%20equator%20on%20the%20celestial%20sphere) of the Earth🌍(\${rainbowTilt} mt): the Tropics of [Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer#:~:text=northernmost%20circle%20of%20latitude%20where%20the%20Sun%20can%20be%20seen%20directly%20overhead)♋(\${rainbowCanc} m$\phi$) and [Capricorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Capricorn#:~:text=the%20southernmost%20latitude%20where%20the%20Sun%20can%20be%20seen%20directly%20overhead)♑️(\${rainbowCapr} m$\phi$), and the [Arctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle#:~:text=the%20southernmost%20latitude%20at%20which%2C%20on%20the%20winter%20solstice%20in%20the%20Northern%20Hemisphere%2C%20the%20Sun%20does%20not%20rise%20all%20day%2C%20and%20on%20the%20Northern%20Hemisphere%27s%20summer%20solstice%2C%20the%20Sun%20does%20not%20set) (\${rainbowArc0} m$\phi$ -- \${rainbowArc1} m$\phi$ = \${rainbowArc2} m$\phi$) and [Antarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circle#:~:text=the%20Sun%20is%20above%20the%20horizon%20for%2024%20continuous%20hours%20at%20least%20once%20per%20year%20(and%20therefore%20visible%20at%20solar%20midnight)%20and%20the%20centre%20of%20the%20Sun%20(ignoring%20refraction)%20is%20below%20the%20horizon%20for%2024%20continuous%20hours%20at%20least%20once%20per%20year%20(and%20therefore%20not%20visible%20at%20solar%20noon)) (\${rainbowAnt0} m$\phi$ -- \${rainbowAnt1} m$\phi$ = \${rainbowAnt2} m$\phi$) Circles. Each Dec time zone is exactly one [deciparallel]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a tenth of a circle of longitude"} (d$\lambda$) wide and one meridian ($\phi$) long.

Time zones can also be labeled with color🎨. The ten Dec time zones are numbered \${rainbow0rng} to \${rainbow9rng} like the ten meridians that separate them. The time zone numbers are [deciday]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="a tenth of a day"} (dd) offsets from Zone \${rainbow0zon}. In contrast, [UTC time zone offsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset#:~:text=the%20difference%20in%20hours%20and%20minutes%20between%20Coordinated%20Universal%20Time%20(UTC)%20and%20the%20standard%20time%20at%20a%20particular%20place) range from \${rainbowN5zn} dd to \${rainbowP583} dd. UTC time zone with negative offsets are about Zones \${rainbow6zon} to \${rainbow9zon} are about one day ahead of their closest UTC counterpart.

Unlike the other major parallels, the position of the Equator is fixed and independent of the Earth's🌍[axial tilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#Earth:~:text=the%20angle%20between%20the%20ecliptic%20and%20the%20celestial%20equator%20on%20the%20celestial%20sphere).

To measure time, Dec uses years and days. Years are turns of a celestial body around [the point it orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter_%28astronomy%29#:~:text=the%20point%20about%20which%20the%20bodies%20orbit).

The distinguishing characteristics of Dec are its simplicity and consistency. These qualities are evident when comparing Dec and [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time#:~:text=the%20primary%20time%20standard%20globally%20used%20to%20regulate%20clocks%20and%20time) time zones using the [toggle](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/input-toggle)✅inputs beneath the world🌏map🗺️below⬇️.

The UTC time⏳zones to the East of New Zealand have negative UTC offsets and filled in with reddish colors. By design, all Dec time⏳zones have positive offsets. Therefore, Zones 6 to 9 are roughly 1 day ahead of their UTC analogs unless we subtract 10 to make their offsets negative.


The time in any Dec time⏳zone differs from the closest UTC time⏳differ by -5 to 5 [centiturns]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="hundredths of a turn"}. When comparing the time in a Dec and UTC time⏳zones, there is no difference between Zone 0 and UTC+00:00 or Zone 5 and UTC+12:00. [Deciturns]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="tenths of a turn"} and hours do not line up perfectly.

UTC+00:00 is in the middle of Zone 0, but makes detours to include Iceland and other islands. Except for such detours, each UTC time zone is 41.6̅ milliturns wide.

The ISO🌐8601 format is

The ISO🌐8601 [time⏳interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals:~:text=the%20intervening%20time%20between%20two%20time%20points) from now until midnight can be expressed without including the current time as , which is equivalent to the Dec span🌈.

ISO🌐8601 and Dec are  different objectives. ISO🌐8601 seeks to standardize how we measure time, whereas Dec aims to completely redefine how we measure time.


Unlike ISO🌐8601, the documentation describing Dec is available for free under a [Creative Commons license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#:~:text=one%20of%20several%20public%20copyright%20licenses%20that%20enable%20the%20free%20distribution%20of%20an%20otherwise%20copyrighted%20%22work%22). While ISO🌐8601 standardizes,

 can be split two components: the Dec calendar🗓️(Decalendar) and clock🕓(Declock).
The year in Dec is the same as in the
Dec counts🧮years and days as integers and fractions. In Dec, the [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal#:~:text=the%20integer%20written%20to%20the%20left%20of%20the%20decimal%20separator) and [fractional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_part#:~:text=the%20excess%20beyond%20that%20number%27s%20integer%20part) part of a year form a date, while the fractional part of a year. The fractional years are expressed by  while [fractional days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time#Fractional_days) are . since the Dec [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch#:~:text=an%20instant%20in%20time%20chosen%20as%20the%20origin%20of%20a%20particular%20calendar%20era), Dec tracks the date as and the time of day as fractional days using a single number called the [doy]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="day-of-year"}.
In essence, Decalendar and Declock  count🧮fractions of a year and a day, respectively. The numerator and denominator for Decalendar is the number of days in the year, and the Declock denominator is $10^x$, where $x$ is the number of digits in the numerator. In both systems, only the numerator, not the denominator, is provided. In the context of Decalendar, the numerator is the days that have passed in the year, while in the context of Declock, the numerator is the parts of the day that have passed in the day.

To avoid any confusion between the two, we can say [Day 5]{.underline .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="March 6"} to mean the date when 5 days have passed this year or [Day 0]{.underline .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="March 1"} to mean the first day-of-year ([doy]{.under .tool data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="day-of-year"}). This is like the use of the term "day zero" in other contexts, such as epidemiology. The analogous term for times is "Dot". The word "Dot" conveys that at its core Declock is a system built on [fractional days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time#Fractional_days) expressed as decimal numbers. The 5 in "Dot 5" can be thought of as a number after a decimal (0.5) or a numerator (⁵/₁₀), either way it means noon, the time when half the day has passed.

The analogy to decimals or fractions is important, because it explains why adding a zero at the end of a time does not change the time, only the implied tolerance of time points or the implied duration of time intervals. If Dot 5 is a time point, it has an implied tolerance of 5% of the day ($.5±.05$), because any time after Dot 45 and before Dot 55 ($[.45, .55)$) would round to Dot 5. On the other hand, if Dot 5 is the start time for a time interval, that interval is implied to start at Dot 5 and end before Dot 6 ($[.5, .6)$) and thus have a duration of 10% of the day (Dot 6-Dot 5). Every additional digit we add decreases the implied tolerance and the implied duration 10-fold.

If we really want to insist on punctuality, we could include up to 5 digits in a time. Specifying times with more than 5 digits is possible, and may be useful for scientific or technical purposes, but it is analogous to providing [extremely long GPS coordinates](https://xkcd.com/2170/); at some point the level of precision stops having relevance to daily life. If we want to strive for the highest level of precision possible, we can add the word "sharp" or the `#` symbol to the time. Saying "5 Sharp" or writing `5#` means as close as possible to noon. Times that include `#` cannot have an implied duration. We can only add `#` to a time, so there is no need say "Dot 5 Sharp" or write `.5#`.
